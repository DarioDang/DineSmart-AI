A small complete bar is to your right as you enter - we were quickly seated at a postage stamp sized table. The menu is basically what the chef fancies to prepare for dinner - so on-line menus just list items that are basic rather than recommended for each evening. I enjoy one of the best prepared filet Mignons I have eaten in a long time and shared some of my wife's risotto and a house made bread to make a wonderful tasting meal! Although they were very busy, our server took her time with us to ensure we got the best of what they had to offer - including a very tasty Pinot Noir fro the region. \\n\\nHighly recommend and will be back!\",\n",

We were hurried through our entree and main, and the request of dessert was hurried. We said no to dessert as we weren't ready, and the bill immediately came to the table. We hadn't finished our drinks and felt like we were just being pushed out the door. We had a reservation by the way, 6pm, Sunday night. Hardly a peak busy night where they are trying to turn people through quickly. Otherwise service was prompt and \\\"polite\\\" enough.

The mains were a special risotto of pears and spring onions and ricotta that tasted so much like freshness on a plate, and the venison special, which melted in our mouths.

We had the scallop and chorizo app, 300g rib eye special, and a couple cocktails. The star of the show was the Rib Eye with duck fat and horseradish cream; I have lived in the Midwest US for the past 5 years and I thought it was in definite competition with steak I have had in the meat Mecca, which is saying a lot. Sadly we didn't stay for dessert but they had several that I considered, get one so I can live vicariously thru you.\",\n",

They start you off with wonderfully fresh sourdough pumpkin hummus bread.  They also had a pretty extensive wine list with delicious selections!\\n\\nThe most delicious part of our meal was the chargrilled chicory, cauliflower, dates with a coconut yogurt (tasted like lemon ricotta cheese) and organic greens.  \\n\\nWe also had the soup or the day - which was yam with spinach and buttermilk topped with amazing pesto. Delicious and warm - perfect for a cold night. We alsohad the special appetizer of the day - scallops with chorizo. The scallops were a tad small - but I always feel like restaurants overcharge for scallops - so this was somewhat to be expected. We finished off with the beef fillet with vegetables, potato and Yorkshire pudding.  The beef fillet was cooked perfectly and since we got the leaner cut of meat, they added camembert cheese - yum!\",\n",

You definitely need a reservation, especially if you're coming in after 6pm.\\n\\nThey start you off with a thick piece of herby bread and butter and a jug of lemon water. To drink I tried a glass of the \\\"skin ferment\\\" wine, which I'd never heard of, but the servers insisted it was worth a try. It has a reddish orangey color, kind of like rum punch. And it tastes a bit like fruit juice or cider. It wasn't bad! I don't know that I would order it again with dinner, but it could be a fun drink-outside-with-your-friends wine, like rosé's cousin.\\n\\nFor dinner I went with the herb crusted salmon over a bed of roasted potatoes, tomatoes, and capers. It was pretty good, but I wasn't able to finish it. The salmon portion was huge and it was just drenched in herbs; too much for my taste. The potatoes and tomatoes were on point though!\\n\\nService is friendly, but slow. It took awhile for my order to be taken, and my wine came after my food. \\n\\nOverall a decent dinner. I'd be curious to try some of their other dishes.\",\n",

Definitely make a reservation as it is a cozy place with limited seating. \\n\\nTo begin, the decor is adorable and welcoming; the staff is super friendly and attentive; and the seating is comfortable and cozy. \\n\\nI sat alone, but had great conversation with the different staff. One of my servers discussed my wine tastes before letting me try two before settling on a glass. Both of her picks were spot on AND she let me know that a bottle was open that was not normally open so I could try a glass of that, as well. Really great service there. \\n\\nLet's start with the bread- homemade heaven with butter. Crumbles in your mouth. I don't normally eat bread- this bread is bomb.\\n\\nI was having trouble deciding on the menu since everything that was delivered near me looked and smelled amazing. \\n\\nI settled on the roasted red capsicum tomato and red onion soup with got cheese, terragon and lemon creme fraiche. While not a fan of goat cheese (AT ALL) this was a delight hunt of flavor in a wonderful soup. It's light and creamy but still satisfying and bursting with flavor. They also let me get a *teacup* size since I didn't want to ruin my appetite on the starter. \\n\\nFor the main, I chose the Pan fried salmon with capers, garlic crush potatoes, summer veg, and a banana prawns + lobster Marie Rose sauce topped with a cucumber salsa. The salmon fell apart on my plate. Even the roasted tomatoes on the side were amazing. \\n\\nI've had salmon 4 times while traveling NZ- this one takes the cake by far. This meal was fabulous and a great way to close out my New Zealand adventure.\",\n",

Amazing. Best meal of the two week trip through Auckland, Queenstown, Rotorua, and Wellington. We've been to several of the \\\"Best Of...\\\" restaurants on this trip and there was only one other place (Charley Noble in Wellington) that was even close to as good as 5th street. We sat at the Chefs Table which made everything even better because Samson served us and he's one of the co-owners and lead chefs crafting the menu. Such a great dude, and his team is really doin the Lord's work over here. We had four cocktails (Mezcal Milkpunch, Spritz 2x, and the Stirred). The lead bartender is a blast as well and is coming up with some truly delicious, refreshing drinks on this ever-changing menu (so I hear). We got the broccolini, the beef with pickled ginger, potatoes, and the true gem of the meal = the lamb shoulder. The lamb melts in your mouth. Do not hesitate for a second to order it even if you're not a big red meat eater! I'm sitting here at the airport not an hour removed from dinner and I had to write this review because of the lamb AND the quality of service. Props to Samson, Chris, and the third mustached musketeer / co-owner for creating such a memorable dining experience. And if you're wondering, \\\"is this guy still buzzed from the drinks he ordered at dinner?\\\" The answer is \\\"Hell yes. I couldn't NOT order a 4th cocktail.\\\" Anyway, cheers to the 5th street team for the beautiful work you're doing. We'll think of you every time we talk about our trip to NZ and/or use the chili oil we bought on our way out.\",\n",
