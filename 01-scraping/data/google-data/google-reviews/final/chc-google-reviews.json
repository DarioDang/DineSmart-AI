Disgusting, old tasting, poor service, cold food and expensive for what it is. What a shame to see the Sun Ning become this. The people that started it really did a great job with the most basic of food, and the place can no longer provide even that.",

The servings are super generous, there is a lot of meat and they are big pieces too, they were very reasonably priced, the chicken chowmein and chicken and cashew were loaded with meat as well as heaps of delicious veges. The beef in the fried rice was so tender. The sweet and sour pork was still a little bit crunchy which was lovely, with a perfectly balanced sweet but tangy sauce, and delicious won tons too. Thoroughly enjoyed, thank you! Also very busy at 6pm so is a good sign, and seemed to be quick cooking and getting the food out to customers. Top marks from us.",

The place was super busy and every table was full so we were there at the right time.\nWe had 2 cocktails to shared. I had a basil chilli crispy pork with rice while my husband had a tofu veggie peanut sauce stir-fry with rice. The food was delicious but massive 😂 we were so full before we could get through the whole plate so had to skip the dessert!\nThe lady who look after the door and casher was super friendly and calm with the crazy paces of people come and go and needed to go to the threter!\nThe restaurant is in a beautiful colourful stripe 🌈🌃",

As someone who's sampled Thai cuisine extensively, I can confidently say this was not only the best Thai food I've ever had but also ranks among the most exceptional meals of my life. The dishes were a symphony of flavors, expertly crafted and bursting with freshness.\n\nBeyond the incredible food, the staff's warmth and attentiveness truly stood out. Their genuine smiles and dedication to customer satisfaction created a welcoming and delightful atmosphere. Fawn (the owner) was incredibly sweet and a lovely person overall!\n\nWithout hesitation, I will be returning to The Nook Thai Eatery and enthusiastically recommending it to anyone visiting Christchurch. Do yourself a favor and prepare for a truly unforgettable meal.",

                "text": "Honestly, quite disappointed with the overall experience. The food was way below average compared to other restaurants, especially considering their higher prices. The curry had an unusually strong color, which made it look artificial, and the taste was almost bland.\n\nWhat really stood out was the hospitality — it felt noticeably friendlier toward local customers than towards us. No one even asked how the food was, and most of the attention seemed focused on impressing the locals.\n\nTo add, this wasn’t our first odd experience here. A few years ago, we walked in and were told there were no tables available unless we had a booking. Just out of curiosity, my wife called them right after we stepped out, and suddenly, they said a table was available. When we went back in, they realized their mistake and apologized, but the whole situation felt quite uncomfortable — almost as if they didn’t really want us there in the first place.\n\nOverall, not a place I’d return to or recommend. There are plenty of restaurants around offering much better food, value, and respect for all customers.\n\nUpdate on your response\n\nThank you for your response. I understand you may see things differently, but I’ve simply shared my honest experience as a paying customer. It’s disappointing that instead of taking the feedback constructively, the reply came across as defensive and personal.\n\nAlso, thank you for taking the time to look into my Facebook account to find my mutual friends — that level of effort says a lot in itself.\n\nRegardless of what your internal notes or assumptions might say, my experience at the table didn’t feel welcoming — and as a customer, that’s what matters most. Feedback is meant to help improve service, not start a debate or a personal investigation.\n\nI wish your team the best and hope future customers have a better experience.",

They takes little bit of  time because they don’t keep most of the food and items on the freezer and just heat them and give them to the customers like other restaurants. They cook fresh and give you larger portions and cheaper prices compared to other places. I personally recommend to buy or order food from here if you really want to eat fresh . They even make paneer in an organic way from fresh milk. If you ordered and wait around 15 to minutes then you will be served a healthy, delicious and fresh food. I can’t wait to eat next time.",

No apology nothing just “we’re right you’re wrong!” Then to add insult to injury 3 roti ordered, we couldn’t find the 3rd and yelled at again!! Will never support this business.

Phad Thai was extremely spicy for a medium which wouldn't usually bug me but I have severe indigestion so needed a maximum of medium. And it was literally just over cooked spicy mush and I gave up eating it not even a third of the way through. Roti was cold and stale- reminded me of stale pie pastry rather than the classic Thai roti I was craving... very disappointing. Green curry was okay ish,  but still disappointed again as I've often made a lot better myself. At the end of the day, I was wanting to treat myself and this just ended up being a disappointing waste of money. Wouldn't go here again.",

The curry puffs were like curry mash wrapped in pastry. I asked for fresh sping rolls and was given fried spring rolls.\n\nThe service itself was okay communication barrier was a little difficult as we both struggled to understand each other but having the menu infront to be able to point at what I wanted was helpful. It seemed like a very busy place as when I was being served the person serving me had to keep going away to had out orders or answers the phone.\n\nThe place was clean tidy doesn't look like much foot traction comes through but if there were to be people dine in they would probably want to play somthing other than infomercials.\n\nDon't be fooled by the pictures as the look of the pictures definitely does not match the taste of the food. It's not a place I'll be going back to especially if I'm going to be spending over $80 I expect the quality and taste to be some what decent.",

Vomiting, stomach cramps, nausea etc. The 5 of us who fell ill were the 5 who ate the prawns. The one person who did not get sick, had the chicken.\nI would not have given a 1 star review had the restaurant responded differently to our email letting them know we all got sick. Their response \"The staff also ate the prawns and did not get sick\".\nWe without a doubt got food poisoning from this restaurant, we all got sick at the same time, all with the same symptoms.

I've travelled to Canada, USA, Europe, India, Thailand, Indonisia, Vietnam, bugger me a lot of places. But this Chow Mein from this little freaking taker in Christchurch, IS ABSOLUTELY FREAKING AMAZING. The veg has been cooked perfect, the amount of meat to veg ratio is spot on, the sauce is to die for, the overall portion allows me to have 2 days worth of dinners. The staff were friendly, and the place was packed. I saw several customers bring their own boxes to take away their orders, as they ordered upto 8 items to feed their family. Folks, this place is amazing. I ordered the chow mein as a base line. If this is good then the rest is going to be amazing. Go to this place.",

We dined here for a friend’s birthday using First Table, and he took the time to clearly explain the T&Cs to our group and even gave thoughtful recommendations based on our tastes.\n\nUnfortunately, we had an issue with the First Table discount when it came to the bill, and one of the female staff members handled it terribly! Speaking rudely about us, right in front of us (not realising one of us understood her language). We also overheard another table complaining about the same staff member’s attitude, so it clearly wasn’t just us.\n\nThankfully, Suresh completely turned the experience around.

                "text": "We were recommended to go to Coriander's Restaurant whilst visiting Christchurch as we were told they had a very good vegan menu.  We decided to go after a comedy show & arrived at the St Asaph St Corianders at 9.30pm very hungry.  Staff were very welcoming & said they were open until 11pm so we could get a table for two.  We explained that we needed all our food to be Vegan & Gluten-free & they said they could do that.  We ordered vegetable pakoras & onion bhajis for starters & a glass of wine each which was all very delicious.  The waitress bought out a yoghurt sauce with the starters which was quickly whisked away by the head waiter as it had dairy in it.  So we thought that they had the allergies & dietary requirements sorted.  We ordered two curries to share with rice as our main both from the vegan menu & were told that the curries were also GF & Vegan (we always ask several times as this combination is very rarely catered for well at any cafe or restaurant anywhere in NZ).  Everything was absolutely delicious & we were impressed with the soya chunks in the curries (used instead of chicken in the vegan curries), so much so that I asked where I could source it for my Vegan, 99% GF wholefood cafe in Timaru.  I was told by the waiter that it was called Soya Chaap & could get the tins of it at local Indian Supermarket or through food service providers.  Later that night my husband was feeling very uncomfortable with gut pain & bloating & the next day he was not well at all, barely able to function.  He is very intolerant to gluten (basically a coeliac), but we couldn't figure it out as we were sure that Coriander's had catered to our vegan & GF needs.  We decided to go to the Indian Supermarket to buy some of those tins of Soya Chaap & to our great disappointment discovered that they contained not only soy, but gluten wheat flour which was the 1st ingredient.  So as we own a 99% GF cafe, I definitely couldn't use it at all.  We are very hot on making sure the 1% of ingredients that do contain Gluten in our cafe (organic oat milk & organic date scones) do not ever get cross contaminated with the GF ingredients (as my hubby is very intolerant of course).  Anyway, I am very sorry to have to write all of this as we initially were thoroughly impressed with the service & the delicious food but I feel like I had to do this review to let other folks who are GF know that they can't have the vegan curries with the soy pieces in them as not GF.  My hubby was sick enough from just one meal but it could have been much worse for someone with chronic Coeliac Disease.  Suggest staff need more training all round both FOH & Kitchen staff as they may not be aware of the gluten content of the Soya Chaap they are using but it was clearly labelled on the tins of all the different brands at the Indian Supermarket.  We won't be going back unfortunately, which we are very sad about.",

It took over 50 minutes from when our booking was to be given the ordering sheet. It then was another 20 before we started seeing food brought out. Then after only 40 minutes of eating we were told our time was up and we had to put our last orders in. Koji is meant to be a great experience where you can slowly eat small portions over a longer period and have a great night and really appreciate the food. All we got to do was pay $75 to be rushed through my food. I didnt get a chance to order desert and overall it was a waste of money. I know I wasn't the only one at the birthday dinner left disappointed. .\n\nCan't say I recommend it based off that.",

Menu jest nowoczesne, oparte na świeżych, lokalnych składnikach, a wszystko podane z ogromną dbałością o szczegóły. Zamówiłam burgera z jagnięciną i to był jeden z najlepszych posiłków, jakie jadłam w Nowej Zelandii – soczyste mięso, świeże warzywa i idealnie doprawiony sos. Obsługa była przemiła i bardzo profesjonalna, widać, że zespół naprawdę lubi to, co robi. Samo wnętrze jest stylowe, ale bez przesady – ciepłe światło, rośliny i przyjemna muzyka w tle. To idealne miejsce zarówno na lunch, jak i wieczorną kolację po dniu pełnym wrażeń. Czułam się tam swobodnie, a jedzenie naprawdę zrobiło na mnie ogromne wrażenie.

                "text": "I had been wanting to order from here for ages after hearing good things about this place from Friends. Finally had the opportunity tonight and my review is a little mixed.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews I knew that there would likely be a long waiting time for the food. They opened at 4:30pm, and we called through to order at around 5:10pm. They quoted a wait time of 1 hour and 15 minutes. We were happy with this as we had called in early.\n\nThe wait time ended up being pretty accurate - which was good service. When my partner came to collect around 6:30ish another person came into order and left pretty quickly after being quoted a 2 hour wait time for food. This seems like a major issue for this place - they can’t handle many orders as there is only one guy cooking the food.\n\nWe ordered mild chicken green curry and chicken Pad Thai. The portion size of the Pad Thai was great and the Pad Thai was good. For $15 this was great value for money but taste wise was not anything amazing.\n\nUnfortunately the big let down for me was the green curry which  was what I was most looking\nforward to / craving the most. Green curry is my usual dish at places at little high, thai orchard etc.\n\nOn the phone the lady asked if we wanted the curry mild, medium or hot. We said mild and\nshe repeated back to us that it was mild we were  ordering. My Partner can handle a bit a spice, but I can’t so I always like to get mild to get a mild spice flavour or no spice at all.\n\nTHE CURRY TASTED LIKE SPICY WATER. I’m certain I was probably given a hot curry by mistake because it was so hot I couldn’t eat any\nof it. My partner also said it was very hot and he couldn’t have a lot of it due to the bland flavour / texture. I can acknowledge when a dish is spicy and flavourful - however all you could taste was spicy water. It was horrible and went straight into the bin which is a real shame. No nice curry texture, coconut or anything. I wouldn’t recommend the curry even if you could handle the spice. No flavour, bland and tasted awful - the spice didn’t even match the flavour profile of a typical spicy green curry.\n\nDue to the fuss with the waiting time, probably won’t come back here again as it’s not really worth it. Very disappointing :(",

The shahi paneer was just as amazing, rich, creamy, and made with so much love that every bite melts in your mouth. I also tried lamb anar masala and chicken Bhuna masala just loved every bite of that. I never ever had that kind of lamb in my whole life. If you are craving authentic Indian food with top-notch service, this is the place to be. Highly recommend!

We decided to make it easy for two of us and ordered a platter for two.  We did not have lunch but still could not finish all the meat and the fries.  Our comment is that be prepared to be hungry for platter for two.  A staff came and offered a box; relatively friendly and good service. The sausage was good. Meat was tender; it would be better if we could taste a bit more smoky on the meat.  Overall it was good food and tasted good with hands and figures.

We reminded her of the 2 pizzas and chips. She had NOT placed our order with the kitchen. 5 min and the chips arrived. Another 10 - 15 minutes and we had our pizza.\nThis delay over shadowed the meal which was ok. Venison pieces were sparse and chewy. Chips were great but could be because we were getting quite hungry.\nWe ended up 20mins late for our 8pm concert.\nDisappointing.\n\nUpdated. Received an apology voucher. Thank you.

The coffee was also 10/10, so good I ordered two! I had such a good experience that I had to come back the weekend after.

Our starter arrived at the same time as our mains, so was barely touched, we were not meal checked at all, and my sirloin was so chewy half remained on my plate, my daughter's Flintstone was tender, but her duckfat potatoes had been cooked in a dirty fryer, should be golden, not brown and crumbly. As the nervous waitress (also smelling strongly of cigarette smoke), didn't know seasonal veges we took pity on her and ordered salads, also acceptable but nothing great. Staff were apologetic about mixup in delivery and offered 1 free drink, which i didn't accept, I expected the starter to not be charged for. They took it off with reluctance, and when presented with gold card she took it, but didn't get right discount. Unfortunately she didn't offer receipt, and I was to flustered to ask.\nDefinitely will not be returning.",

Self service water and you have to pay at the counter then get your number to waiting for your food at the table. On that day I didn’t order chicken luksa by my friend recommended but I ordered Tom yum noodles soup instead. When my food coming the portions is enough for 1 or you can share with your friend if you didn’t eat much. The soup was tasty a little bit spicy and sour. You will get a lot of rice noodles in your soup. It good to have soup in cold weather. 19$ for one meal is not to expensive for my opinion at this stage. And also they have a lot of variety food you can choose to try like spicy beef bamboo, pork omelette and chicken on rice. Recommended to try to have food in this restaurant. If you like spicy you can ask staff to made more spicy 🌶️☺️",

The boys (in my opinion) were very well behaved sitting at the table playing with their toys. She apologised to the table next to us regarding the truck and paper on the floor loud enough for us to hear. We all commented on how uncomfortable she made us feel and felt like she wanted us to leave. We were appalled with her attitude and the service we received.

I wish the Dirtyland would make it very obvious that they are closed on Sundays and Mondays as I love this place and its such a drag to go and its closed.

As an in-house restaurant the decor is toned down, but pleasant. The staff are both friendly and attentive. The menu choice is smaller than you might expect at an Indian restaurant, but the food was well cooked, being very well spiced and delicious. I had Paneer Padkora entree, which is made using their own made Paneer. It was my first try of tbis dish and I wasnt disappointed. For main I had Chicken Kadhi (hot) with plain rice and Naan. The main was beautifully spiced with great balance and very tasty. The rice portion was spot on, enough to enjoy with the main, leaving enough gravy to mop up using the Naan. It was a great meal, and I would definitely go again.",

The other night I came with my friends, and one of us had dietary requirements which I made it clear to the waitress during ordering - she was Muslim. I spoke in Mandarin Chinese so there’s no way she heard me incorrectly. Since we didn’t want to risk meat, we ordered from the “Vegetables” section on the ordering IPad. Now, I’ve never personally ordered from this tab because my family are meat lovers so I thought these were all completely vegeterian dishes. On the IPad ordering system there’s also nothing indicating what has meat and what doesn’t. Now I understand that the waitress probably thought the eggplants were for the rest who wasn’t Muslim so she didn’t say anything but I don’t understand why a dish with meat would be in the vegetable section. They should make it that more clear with labels on every dish on what’s vegeterian and what isn’t for any future vegetarians/vegans/muslims. However, I do have to say that the waitress did do a nice job defusing the situation, she allowed us to order another dish and this time walked us through what’s ACTUALLY vegetarian in the vegetable section and changed my friend’s rice, plates, cutleries, etc. We also had no issues with their other dishes. But again, I’d advise all vegetarians/vegans/muslims to be careful while ordering and understand that their “vegetable” section isn’t vegetarian until they change that, or just go to a different Chinese restaurant to be safe. :)",

The dishes are always fresh and delicious. The boss, who is also the chef, often comes out to chat with customers and listen to their feedback.\n\nLast week, I ordered a seafood noodle for my daughter. Since we had just recovered from a stomach ache, I asked the staff to make it less salty. The noodles came out exactly as we expected — light, comforting, and tasting just like homemade food.\n\nI truly love this place — from the food to the staff, even the cozy decoration.

It’s actually authentic Thai food so definitely go try and the prices are reasonable as well. For 2 adults we usually only get an entree and a main as portions are quite good.\n\nThe guy who was at the front desk tonight gave great service as well.\n\nIt’s been quiet at the restaurant every time we have gone in as they seem to get uber orders and takeaway orders regularly.",

They specialize in affordable, clean-tasting, and light ramen, and even have $10 lunch specials on weekdays!\n\n⸻\n\n👛 Transparent Pricing, Super Wallet-Friendly\n•\tSignature ramen is only $12.8 — easily one of the most affordable bowls in Christchurch\n•\t$10 weekday lunch specials with great variety — and no, they’re not just filler dishes!\n\n🍜 Light Broth, Springy Noodles\nI ordered the seafood ramen, and the broth was unexpectedly light and non-greasy. It’s that kind of clean, refreshing soup that won’t leave you thirsty afterward. The noodles were perfectly cooked with a nice bounce, and the toppings included fresh shrimp, half a marinated egg, greens, and wakame seaweed. Great value for the price!\n\n💧 No free noodles, but free soup refills!\nIf you’re a broth lover like me, this is a huge plus. The free soup refill makes the whole meal feel extra satisfying and cozy.\n\n🍱 The $10 Lunch Specials Are a Hidden Gem\nTheir rice bowl lunch sets are just $10 and perfect for a quick and filling midday meal. The portion is decent too — definitely enough to keep you going through the afternoon.\n\n📦 Their takeaway packaging is adorable!\nThe ramen comes in a pull-tab container that looks like a drink can. Super cute, totally Instagram-worthy, and still keeps the soup hot — love that fun detail!\n\n⸻\n\n✅ Who I’d Recommend This To:\n•\tAnyone who loves ramen but prefers it on the lighter, less salty side\n•\tStudents or office workers looking for a solid meal without breaking the bank\n•\tPeople who enjoy clean, simple flavors and unique presentation styles\n\n⸻\n\nVerdict:\nSoshite Hikari doesn’t go for flashy gimmicks, but wins your heart with honest pricing and gentle, satisfying broth. Whether you’re a local or a traveler on a budget, this spot is definitely worth checking out!",

The peanut dipping sauce on the side was rich and creamy, perfectly tying it all together. A great way to start the meal!\n\n🍜 5-Star Fried Vermicelli – This dish was a standout! Smoky wok-fried vermicelli, topped with crispy shallots, lemongrass chicken, and just the right hint of spice. It had that perfect balance of texture—crispy edges with soft noodles underneath.\n\n🍚 5-Star Special Broken Rice – A total flavour bomb. The grilled pork chop was juicy and marinated to perfection, paired with a crispy spring roll, shredded pork skin, and a soft egg. The rice was fragrant and fluffy, and the fish sauce drizzle brought everything together.\n\nService was friendly, food came out fast, and the portions were generous. Highly recommend if you’re after authentic, satisfying Vietnamese in town.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Would definitely come back!",

My partner enjoys the best Pilsner in NZ, the lighter Kolsch, Uprising blonde ale & particularly the unusual turmeric flavoured pilsner... Oh and some tasty guest beers or several tantalising gins from across NZ!\n\nWe loved it so much that we held our wedding reception here! Now it's great roomy beer shed has become the favourite regular haunt for us, accompanied by some cool live bands,  musical playlists & tasty in-house food. With welcoming & considerate bar staff to polish off the experience & a cosy log fire for those cold nights, we look forward to going there every time, without fail... that said, there's always Two Thumb on Colombo as a trendy alternative.",

The garlic naan and vindaloo is authentic tasting and what I’m looking for. Good serving sizes also for the price. Absolutely recommend if your looking for Indian food in this area",

I ordered several different curries for my family, and each one was a masterpiece. The butter chicken was creamy and rich, the lamb rogan josh was tender and full of flavour, and the vindaloo had the perfect amount of heat. Everything was packaged perfectly and arrived hot, which isn't always the case with delivery. The generous portions and incredible taste made the price feel justified. This is hands-down the best Indian takeaway in Christchurch, and I'll definitely be ordering from them again",

But it did have a nice chargrilled sear. The\r black garlic purée tasted burnt and the texture was very grainy. \r\r\rFor $45 dollars, the dish felt incomplete.\n\nThe Pappardelle al ragù di cervo, braised venison ragù with juniper and thyme,\nfinished with berries and crème fraîche looked amazing and the fruit gave the rich sauce some welcome, acidic respite. Unfortunately the pasta and the sauce were severely lacking seasoning.\n\nIt was interesting that the restaurant styles itself as an Italian inspired eatery but there was no Italian wine on offer. Not to worry though, as the Mt Difficulty Pinot Noir was a fine accompaniment to all the dishes.\n\nWhere things really went off the rails was the level of service we received or didn't receive. When our starter was finished, our plates and cutlery were not cleared before the main came out out. There was no cutlery for the main at all, including the rather essential steak knife. We had to approach the bar staff in order to find some wait staff to then get us what we needed to eat our dishes.\n\nThe server who attended to us was very apologetic and rectified the issue straight away, and even asked us if we'd like more drinks or desserts --- something we had yet to be asked by the other staff who had previously attended us.\n\nWhen it was time to pay, the front of house staff member who collected the bill did not think to ask how we found the meal and we left rather disappointed overall.",

Restaurant front is inviting and interior has a cool layout; person who took our order was welcoming. My nephew and I ordered the lunch special to go, comes with choice of curry and comes with rice and Naan bread. He got mild butter chicken and I got hot lamb Rogan Josh. Both consumed within minutes as soon as got home. The spice of my Rogan Josh was expectedly hot, wishing it could go hotter. Naan was hot and fresh. Will come again for sure.\nEdit: visited here again last weekend (Sat 1st Nov 2025) and the food was just as exceptional. Instead of takeaway we dined in this time round; ordered entrees onion bhaji and samosas with complimentary sauces, they were filling and tasty, with just right level of spice. Mains were lamb korma and lamb Rogan Josh, both spicy and delicious. Service was attentive and excellent, can't recommend this place enough. Six stars",

After a while, a staff went up to the counter (maybe record the order or something), I wait until she finished and ready to take my order,  but just after I order the first dish, she likes remembering something and said, “wait a minute, I’m going to give the cutlery to the customer first and I’ll come back” after she said that, I was kind of confused since I was in the middle of taking my order and the cutlery is not necessary to be served immediately when nothing on the table of the customers she mentioned. She took a bit long time and slowly back to the counter to wash her hands (I wonder how dirty the cutlery she just served are). Guess what, while she turned around to me she found new customers behind me and ask me wait for she seating them first! I only need three dishes to order, I believe it’s less time than her wash her hands, she wasted every one’s time to keep herself looks busy! I have to left the restaurant before I loose my temper. They have no service at all !",

He made sure we had everything we needed without us ever having to ask, and even served us with a special anniversary dessert, which made the night extra special.\n\nThe food was outstanding, steak was a perfect 5/5, cooked beautifully and packed with flavor. The pork dish was also delicious, around 4/5, but still very enjoyable.\n\nOverall, it was a night to remember, thanks to the wonderful service, great food, and intimate atmosphere.

The male kiwi waiter seemed distracted by his phone and didn't seem to notice the dirty tables around me. After I got my food, I had to ask for cutlery, which took another 10-15 minutes to arrive.

The fish was good with generous spices at that time. So went back had screwers in pot, didn’t like it as it was quite pale, ingredients weren’t really quality, this was back in Feb. Thought I’d give another go, tried bbq today. They were a bit dry, not enough flavours. We trusted the lady said that’s all you ordered. Then after left, we realised they missed at least 2 things. So if you do go there, make sure they’ve got all you ordered. Worth to check by yourselves. There is not much service now at this place, probably they are getting more tours, no time to look after small group customers. Takes longer to serve, the place is quite loud with people from tours yelling at each other. Thought they’d do good in Christchurch, quite disappointed and definitely not going back.",

Very professional presentation and the food is good value.\n\nYou get what you pay for I guess. And this restaurant certainly delivers on food quality as well as close attention to presentation.\n\nThe standard of service is what you would expect from an establishment of this calibre. They also offer a good selection of beverages.\n\nMeal prices are in that middle to upper end dining experience. I felt they delivered an experience well worth the money spent. I will certainly dine there again.\n\nVery nice place. Pleasant, friendly, and welcoming staff certainly make the dining experience all about you.\n\nParking is not too bad in the area and can often be found close by.

The pieces of mixed sushi were decent. I was told the 2 rice balls I chosed were crispy chicken & that's what we wanted. But the crispy chicken within tasted like just the crumb coating & only bits of shredded chicken mixed thru. Thought I might have just been unlucky with the first rice ball but the other one we took home was the same. A whole lot of rice & about slightly over a tablespoon of chopped up crumbs. Hope this is not what people are paying full price for. Even though I got what was the end of the day sale...it felt like a total rip off with the crumbs. Ate a lot of crispy chicken rice balls elsewhere but none of them were like these ones. Really strange, baffled & kids really disappointed! I've added the photo to show what was inside & the ratio between \"crispy chicken\" & rice 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️",

The restaurant advertises itself as an all-you-can-eat experience, but it felt like a SCAM.\nThe price had recently changed without any notice, and it wasn’t mentioned when we arrived. We were seated from 5:30 pm to about 7:10 pm and only received about one and a half rounds of food. When we asked for more, the service was painfully slow.\nThere were only four staff members: two chefs cooking, one chef running around, and one lady handling drinks and seating. With just five tables occupied, there’s no reason the service should have been that poor.\nOn top of that, the portions were smaller compared to Tony’s in Riccarton, and the whole experience was frustrating. If you claim to be all-you-can-eat, you should actually deliver that not make customers wait ages for minimal food.\nOverall, this felt misleading and disappointing. I would not recommend the Ferrymead location at all.",

There is chilli oil if you need to put more spice in.\n\nWe got the sliced beef in tongue numbing sauce and the pork dumplings in Sichuan style sauce. The dumplings were soft and flavourful, the pork’s natural oil coated my lips nicely. The sliced beef was the standard velveted beef, the kicker is the sauce. Make sure to have Jasmine rice on the side to soak up all the flavour. They were very generous with the serving, three people could be full with the sliced beef.\n\nThe atmosphere was eccentric, kids would definitely have a blast looking at the paper statues of minecraft characters, a gigantic ice age character with his wallnut, and Chinese decorations. Despite its unusual decor, the temperature and the overall atmosphere makes you feel very at peace while eating and conversing with your loved ones.\n\nI cannot stop talking about how the table and chair are the perfect height in relation to each other, it just makes you feel extra comfortable in the space.\n\nI would highly recommend eating in, the service was very accommodating. They asked for my preference for forks or chopsticks, hot water, and if I needed more spice.\n\nOverall, this place does well in what it does. 5/5.\n\nEdit: We came back again, it was the best fried rice we have ever tasted. I thought it would be the usual fried rice from Chinese takeaways, but this one was different. It was not oily, the wok hei is to die for. They made it spicy just for us because we seem to have ordered only spicy food off the menu, which was nice. The wontons were so soft and tender. The intestine noodle soup was way more flavourful than our usual noodle spot in Riccarton. It definitely satisfied our spicy cravings. The front of house person is always accommodating, a stark contrast to some restaurants around the city.\n\nWe went back for a third time, but didn't realise they are closed on Wednesdays.",

These guys judge you the second you step in line. If you ask why you’re being denied entry, they can’t even give you a straight answer. All you get is some nonsense excuse about “the camera” or whatever. One night they’ll let you in, the next night they’ll tell you you’re not allowed — with zero explanation. And what’s with the so-called dress code? Do they expect everyone to dress exactly the same? What’s the difference between a shirt with a design and a plain one? It feels like they just assume anyone with a bit of style is in a gang or there to cause trouble. That’s pure discrimination, and it’s pathetic. Keep treating people like that, and karma’s going to come right back around — especially when you end up letting the wrong person in because they “look right” to you.  THIS IS BS.",

Mains were the pad see yu, beef cheek curry, lamb shank massamam and sweet and sour chicken. Big portions and you could taste love on the plate.

I found just that at a humble Chinese restaurant in Christchurch — and the best part? It was only $10.\n\nHere’s what I had today:\n•\t🔥 Mapo Tofu – Silky soft tofu with a light kick of spice and that signature numbing flavor. Not too oily, super comforting, and perfect with rice.\n•\t🥬 Stir-fried Celery with Pork – Crisp celery and tender pork slices cooked simply but full of wok hei — tasted just like home cooking.\n•\t🥔 Braised Beef Brisket with Potato – The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the potato soaked up all that rich, savory sauce. It honestly felt like something that had been simmering for hours in a family kitchen.\n\n🍚 Served with a generous portion of steamed white rice, the whole meal felt hearty, warm, and deeply satisfying. No frills, just honest-to-goodness food that reminds you of a meal back home.\n\n📍 If you’re in Christchurch and craving a real Chinese lunch that doesn’t break the bank, this spot is a hidden gem. The dishes change daily too — so there’s always something new to try.",

The buffet options are tasty, quick on-the-go and there's a lot of variety on the menu to choose. It's also halal which is good since there's a limited amount of halal cuisines, especially the good ones. I recommend trying out the buffet option if you're in a rush somewhere or in need of a quick feed, if planning to dine in with the menu choices, I highly recommend the Thai Panang. Overall amazing cuisine, 10/10. Highly recommended trying this place out if you haven't.",

What a delightful discovery.\n\nThe restaurant’s interior is simply stunning. Modern touches blend seamlessly with traditional Burmese details—from the intricately designed menu on the wall and the colorful umbrellas adorning the ceiling, to the striking mural of Burmese women gracing the back wall. It creates a welcoming and culturally rich atmosphere.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped inside, the hospitality was exceptional. The hostess greeted us with genuine warmth, and we were pleasantly surprised when the Chef and members of the kitchen staff came out to say hello. Our waiter was equally impressive—friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nNow, the food. Every dish was a standout. The seafood was perfectly cooked, infused with delicate yet vibrant flavours. The beef curry was melt-in-your-mouth tender, no knife required. I couldn’t get enough of the Tea Leaf Salad—I nearly finished the entire thing myself. We ended on a high note with a dessert that tasted like a comforting blend of warm rice pudding and sponge cake, paired with fresh fruit and cream.\n\nAll in all, Rangoon Ruby offers a truly special dining experience—flavourful, heartfelt, and beautifully executed. It’s an absolute must-try.",

Overall I was satisfied but the customer service I received left a bitter end.\nFirstly, I was going to be charged 20$ more, luckily I realised before I tapped my card. I ordered a mixed grill platter for 1, everything was cooked beautifully down to the sauces however the rump cap was extremely tough. When I sent it back the server wasn't helpful, he said they cannot replace it because I ate most of it, which was a lie (it was practically inedible ) . This went back and forth because I was very frustrated . I then agreed to have it cooked longer (against my will) , to then be given a brand new piece of rump, after all that fuss lol. Quite a disappointing service.",

We were asked if we wanted inside or out, high table or normal size. I ordered a platter so we could supply finger food to our group. It was amazing. We also had chips and wedges which were top class. The service was wonderful and they provided everything we needed. They continued to check on us for any further requests. I thoroughly recommend them for any occasion as there are so many sections of seating that could cater to any group. Well done Valley Inn for making our night perfect.",

It works like the food court classic Hungry Wok, but the flavours are way more authentic and tailored for Chinese tastes.\n\n🍛 Tons of options to choose from, freshly cooked and steaming hot. From what I saw (and tasted!):\n•\tSpicy chicken, tomato-braised chicken, mapo tofu\n•\tStir-fried black fungus and cabbage, sautéed shredded potatoes, dry-fried green beans\n•\tSoy-braised eggplant, Chinese-style scrambled eggs, twice-cooked pork, home-style pork stew…\n\n🍚 You choose one base (white rice, fried rice, or fried noodles) and three hot dishes, all served fast and generously. The flavours are bold and savoury — not overly sweet like Westernised Asian food — perfect for a real Chinese meal.\n\n💬 Staff speaks Mandarin, super friendly and quick service. Perfect for students, workers, or anyone who wants a filling, flavourful lunch or dinner.\n\n🛍️ Located right near Riccarton’s shopping area, so you can grab a hot meal before or after errands. Takeaway boxes are sturdy and packed to the brim. Great value, authentic taste, and fast service — what more do you need?",

                "text": "Barefoot Eatery (Ōtautahi) – Review by Zee Tana\n\nVisited: Friday morning, 10:30am\nDined with: My partner\nOccasion: First-time visit, curious to try a fully vegan spot\n\n⸻\n\nWe decided to try Barefoot Eatery in central Ōtautahi for a relaxed Friday morning breakfast. As a vegan-friendly establishment with a strong online reputation, we had decent hopes — especially for a plant based-aligned offering. Unfortunately, while the café looked good on the surface, the experience didn’t quite live up to the visuals.\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nThe location is central and easy to get to. The space is light, open, and inviting, with an earthy, conscious vibe. However, it was immediately clear that the place was understaffed — just one staff member running front-of-house during a busy Matariki morning crowd. They were doing their best, but the service naturally suffered because of it.\n\nService\n\nFriendly but understandably stretched thin. No formal welcome, no check-in at the table, and minimal interaction beyond the counter. With only one person juggling coffee orders, seating, and food delivery, there was little opportunity for engagement or support. For what we paid, we hoped for more than just transactional.\n\nFood & Drink\n\nWe ordered:\n•\t2x Big Vegan Breakfasts\n•\t1 Soy Latte\n•\t1 Long Black / Americano\n\nLet’s start with the highlight: the coffee was excellent — easily the best part of the morning. Smooth, strong, well-balanced, and perfectly made. That alone almost made up for the kai… but not quite.\n\nThe Big Vegan Breakfasts looked amazing when they landed at the table — visually, they were vibrant and beautifully plated. But the flavour didn’t match the appearance:\n•\tThe scrambled tofu was watery and overpowered by the crispy chilli oil — lacking the depth we expected from black salt or seasoning.\n•\tThe mushrooms (only four small slices, and shrivelled) felt like an afterthought.\n•\tThe sausages were small and bland.\n•\tNo butter or spread on the bread, and no salt or pepper available to help adjust the flavour.\n•\tThe beans, tomato, salad, and aioli were delicious and well-balanced, saving the plate from a total letdown.\n\nThe portioning across the plate was inconsistent — some items felt generous, others almost tokenistic. The cost: $91 total, including a 15% Matariki surcharge (not unexpected, but it raised expectations that weren’t met).\n\nOverall Experience\n\nThere’s potential here, especially for vegan kai lovers looking for a light, stylish brunch spot. But for us, the value just didn’t add up. The coffee is worth coming back for — but not the full breakfast experience, not at that price, and not until they sort out the balance between staffing and service.\n\n⸻\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAesthetically pleasing but lacking in substance where it matters most — flavour and service. We left feeling a bit underwhelmed",

The noodles were perfectly chewy, and the sauce was incredible—authentic, flavorful, with just the right amount of numbness from the Sichuan pepper. The only downside? Protein was a bit light for $19.\n\nOverall, pretty satisfying—a great spot for anyone craving bold, authentic noodles.",

The pieces of cod were no bigger than a crumbed fish finger - it was equivalent to a children's size meal.

They open from 5 pm to 8 pm, and I think reservations are a must. The prices are a little on the higher side, but definitely worth it for the quality and experience.\n\nThey also have a Monday and Tuesday deal — 2 selected drinks and 1 pizza for $45.

Luckily everyone at Soul Quarter was understanding and welcomed us in. We had been looking forward to it because we’d been there once before and loved it. So I was so disappointed to be so late, but their friendliness lifted me back up after quite a stressful afternoon. Their food is truly amazing. We had the southern fried chicken and charred broccolini as entrees. They were delicious. We both had steaks as mains and it was just so good. They also have yummy mocktails, we had a berry lab and a strange fruit. Such a special place. We highly recommend.",

We ordered croquets for first, cocktails and for main we ordered the steak and gnocchi. At no point (not while given the menus nor when the order was taken) the waiters (different ones) bothered to notify us that the steak was not included in first table, like they do in other restaurants.\n\ncocktails were very good, croquets not bad (had better but it were good). The mains arrived. The steak was good but relatively small and about 30 percent of it were hard fat. This is not something i would expect in a restaurant, definitely not for this price.\n\nThe gnocchi was excellent but the quantity of gnocchi was small (most of the dish was sauce, that was excellent but that's not the point). We had two more cocktails and finished with affogato which was good. As we paid, i realized the steak wasn't in the deal. I'm not the kind of person to argue so we paid and left. Overall our savings were 24$, definitely not worth it. In general, the whole experience was underwhelming and left a bitter taste. I wouldn't come again.",

The wine was fabulous and his choice of a NZ pinotage (didn’t know we could produce it here?) was sublime. Desserts were perfection and we all left with a very pleasant taste in our mouths.",

Loads of beef, rich black bean flavor, not too salty — perfect with fluffy white rice. I couldn’t stop eating.\n\n🍄 My girlfriend got the Mushroom Chicken Rice\nThe chicken was tender and full of flavor, and the mushrooms soaked up all the delicious sauce. Super comforting and satisfying!\n\n💰 The best part? Both meals together were under $30 — and we were absolutely stuffed. Total bargain!\n\n📌 Highlights:\n✅ Only $13 and seriously filling (this ain’t a small lunch box)\n✅ Cooked fresh to order, served piping hot\n✅ Home-style taste, not oily — easy to eat every day\n\n⏰ Tip: Come during lunch specials for the best value!\n\n⸻\n\nThey also offer Lunch Combo Meals for $15–$16:\n\n👉 $15: Chicken corn soup + 4 mini spring rolls or chips + seasonal veg + chicken/beef fried rice or noodles\n👉 $16: Soup + sweet & sour pork, lemon chicken, fried fish or nuggets + rice + veg\n\n✅ Big portions — no one leaves hungry\n✅ Lots of variety — perfect for switching it up\n✅ No service charge — casual and affordable for daily lunch!",

We called the restaurant to inform them, and the person on the phone casually said, “Just microwave it for 2 minutes bro.” We explained that we had paid for fresh food, but he insisted it was made fresh “today,” which is already concerning for seafood. When we questioned the freshness, he said he’d bring new fish to “see who’s lying,” but he never showed up.\n\nIt’s really disappointing to see how the quality and customer service have declined.

There was one person in front of me.  He was there when we walked in.  After he made his order, I stood in front of the counter.  Waited.  And waited and waited.  What seemed like 7 or 8 mins.

We ordered their pork ribs and two plates of red eye steaks. As we arrived at the restaurant very early, all the tables were empty. The food was served quickly. The ribs were pre-cut, and the size was small. Upon first trying the meat, it was soft and lacked the grilled, fire-roasted flavor. We ordered the red eye steaks to be served medium and medium-rare, but it turned out the steaks were prepared medium and well done. The fries were good and well prepared. Overall, the service was okay, as the staff couldn't understand and communicate with us well, except for the boss.",

The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, perfect for anything from a casual lunch to a relaxed dinner with friends.\n\nI tried the char kway teow and wat dan hor — both were fantastic. The char kway teow had just the right smoky wok hei, and the wat dan hor came with silky noodles in a rich, eggy sauce that was pure comfort. Everything felt fresh, flavourful, and cooked with care.\n\nThe prices are fair for the generous portions. It’s the kind of place you’ll want to come back to — sometimes for the Malaysian classics, sometimes for a simple, well-made noodle dish.\n\nMust-try: char kway teow, wat dan hor\n\n#AsianEats #LocalGem #ComfortFood",

Since the current owner took over, the quality has dropped and there have been some serious concerns about management.\nAccording to recent news reports and comments, the labour laws are violated, staff were unfairly treated or even forced to take unpaid breaks during rostered hours, and even more worrying, the owner was caught selling recalled products that should have been removed from shelves for safety reasons. This seriously puts customers’ health at risk.\nThe food quality is also not authentic compared to proper Japanese ramen. For example, the “spicy miso ramen” uses Chinese chilli oil instead of Japanese seasoning, which is far from traditional flavour.\nIt’s also unusual to see some new 5-star reviews recently, which strongly makes me question the accuracy of the ratings.\nTo be clear, this review is only about the Colombo St branch. The Samurai Bowl on Wairakei Road is very different – their ramen is authentic and much closer to Japanese standards, and I would recommend dining there instead.",

The broth is light but flavorful, noodles are soft with a nice bite, and the chicken slices were tender. Perfect comfort food, especially if you’ve just landed or heading off on a trip.\n\nPlenty of parking out front and service was friendly.

A lot nicer than I expected it to be.\nThey didn't ask me for my preferred spice level - like most Indian restaurants do, but maybe it's different due to the foodcourt setup?\nThis meant the Tikka Masala was a tad spicy for me, but I still eagerly finished it.\n\nThe portion sizes are a little on the smaller side but I don't eat much so it was perfect for me! I got lots of chicken pieces and the chicken was nice and tender too. Perfectly cooked, thank you!\nBeautiful and friendly staff and I would happily return.\n\n$21 for Curry with rice and a drink.",

The broth was super sweet but that is the only flavour you got. No lemon or accompaniments to go with it. Not even a lemon wedge to squeeze in to it. Grilled pork and spring roll vermicelli salad was probably the better dish. Their nuoc cham was already mixed in which isn't what im used to. Not enough spice or fish sauce. Fried rice not much to say. The wait for food is long. Our friends starter came out probably 15 minutes before ours",

First off, the young waitress accidentally entered the wrong order in, we ordered the sushi+sashimi platter (as it had nigiri and miso soup), but were given the sashimi platter (35$ more expensive). The waitress had confirmed this order when we were ordering as there is only 1 miso soup and she asked if we wanted to order more as we had 3 people. We could tell she was very flustered with her mistake so was happy to pay for the wrong dish despite it being more expensive however asked if we could still get 1 miso soup and 1 rice as that's what was in the original order. The older waitress/manager? then said she was happy to provide free miso but wanted to charge extra for 1 bowl of rice and hinted that it was our fault for not confirming the order when it arrived.\nMid way during the meal a homeless woman walked in and tried to get a seat with the staff. When that didn't work she came to our table to try sit with us in the spare chair we had. I looked to the staff to try get some help and saw 4 of them just standing at the counter watching this happen. You are responsible for the safety of your guests that is in your establishment I am so disappointed.",

Originally gave it a 2 but the owners like to let their business down by trying snarky responses to reviews that they don't like instead of taking constructive criticism on board and fixing their own faults.\n\nWhen we arrived we were greeted and sat and all was very friendly.\nFirst thing we notice is everyone in the restaurant is just yelling so loudly that we couldn't even speak between ourselves. Way too loud and I don't know why. It was like this all night and my ears are still ringing the day after. For this I won't be returning.\n\nThe next thing is we sat for nearly 20mins eating for someone to come and take out order, even just for drinks. We were getting pretty pissed off by this point and was on the verge of leaving because we couldn't talk with it being so loud.\n\nAfter a further nearly 20mins the food came and it was ok. The monkey bread was nice but was pricey just for a mini pizza....\n\nThe quesadilla was good.\n\nThe fried chicken was not. I've never had anything so oily in my life. I ordered the fried chicken sliders and it was just tasteless from the amount of oil onboard the chicken. No care from the chef. Just a basic thing to do...they need some basic chef training to learn how to not make the chicken drip with oil.\n\nAll in all waaaay too loud, too expensive and not that great...the artwork was cool though..you definitely get enough time to look at it because you can't talk because everyone was yelling.\n\nWe weren't the only ones that were complaining about the 2 large tables yelling and filling the entire restaurant with noise. Several others had the same feelings.\n\nNever returning, not recommended.\nGo elsewhere for a better experience....",

The flavor of the ramen and curry has changed, and the staff’s attitude wasn’t very friendly.

Veg spring rolls reminded me of the first time I had Chinese takeaways as a kid, well crispy with a perfect balance of earthy and fresh flavours. You can choose any sauce to substitute for any meal that comes with one, so I got peanut satay for my rolls and it rocked. I love that user-friendly aspect - menu just felt like it was there to explain what they can practically make, and if I wanted it a certain way I felt it could be accomodated. Nobody likes to get charged $2.50 extra because they wanted aioli not ketchup, after all.\nPopping boba limonade was a novelty for me and was a great refreshment against the rich food.",

Not terrible, but for the price I expected a little more. They could’ve added a small salad instead of leaving one of the compartments just for sauce. The sushi tasted like supermarket sushi and the fried dumplings felt like they came from frozen, so that part was a bit of a downside for me. And the Salmon was a bit overcooked in my opinion — the juiciness was gone, which was a bit of a bummer!\n\nStill, a pleasant lunch spot overall — I’d come back for the teppanyaki dishes!",

The puris were perfectly crispy, generously filled, and topped with fresh sev and onions. The pani had just the right balance of tangy, spicy, and refreshing flavors—exactly how pani puri should be. The presentation was clean and inviting, making the whole experience even better. If you’re craving authentic and flavorful street food, Urban Tapri is definitely the place to be!",

Loved how my Mango Chicken wasnt sweet, and the chucks of chicken were nice decent bite size peices. My mums Chicken Korma was a wee bit too hot for her. Id ordered her medium. And for her tastebuds, not as creamy as shes used to having. Our first time trying and Id definately order again. Thanks team!!!",

I would re-order everything we had tonight and, while I didn't take a photo of every plate, let me just say that each of these tasted better than similar dishes I had at a 'higher end' restaurant the night before. I'd be more than happy to order just the croquettes for myself, but add the prawn linguini to it and it's so, so good. Our table also split a rib-eye which was cooked well to our temp, the pork mac & cheese, and the buttermilked fried chicken entree. Very happy with the cocktails as well.  Basically, happy with everything which is why I'm writing this to remind myself that YES I would come back again next time I'm in Christchurch.",

I arrived at 9.45am your display units were full of cooked food lights all on at your counter lots of people eating in the food court. There were no staff at your counter when I used the bell that’s provided for service\nInstead of two friendly faces coming to the front I got one guy I recognised who didn’t say anything and one guy I didn’t recognise snapping at me to wait a moment. They both disappeared round back and I never saw them again. Two women who were sitting came up to me and said they did the same thing and got a nasty response. Lucky for me they recommended the guys right next to your counter and they were fantastic friendly and the sweet soy chicken was delicious.\nI know that you won’t care you didn’t get my money but I’m glad you didn’t and won’t get any of my dollars again.

He didn’t miss a beat and did everything to ensure my friend and I were well taken care of. His hospitable personality is a big reason why I would go back again.\n\nI got the phallow which is like a pork belly stew. It was super tasty! I loved the richness and depth of the flavours. Only thing I would change is the chunks of black cardamon throughout the dish- Instead I’d find a way make it more evenly spread.\n\nWe bought our own bottle of wine along as This is a licensed BYO restaurant.

The sushi was good and the ingredients fresh, although we found it a little sweet, which may be down to the rice they use or added sugar. Plenty of other sushi places in Christchurch would make sushi of similar quality, so I'm surprised at a few of the reveiws waxing lyrical about how good the sushi is.

Worth the 30-Minute Wait🔥\n\nChristchurch finally has real Hong Kong-style claypot rice — and yes,FIRST ONE TO ORDER AT 12:00pm, OTHER CUSTOMER CAME AROUND 12:20PM still I waited 30 minutes, but it was totally worth it.\nThis new spot is still finding its rhythm, so expect a bit of a wait… but once that sizzling pot hits the table, you’ll forget all about the delay.\n\n✨ I ordered the Lup Cheong Claypot Rice — topped with smoky Chinese sausage and crispy-bottomed rice, just like it’s supposed to be. Pour the soy sauce over and mix it up — the aroma alone is enough to bring tears to your eyes 😭\n\nOn the side: THESE CAME REALLY QUICKLY\n\n🌶️ Garlic Pork Belly (蒜泥白肉) — thinly sliced pork belly drenched in garlic-chili sauce. Cold, bold, and the perfect contrast to the hot claypot.\n🍲 Daily Soup — loaded with carrots, mushrooms, bamboo, and pork. Comfort in a bowl.\n\n💡Heads up: It’s made fresh to order, so be patient (we waited 30+ minutes). But honestly? Zero regrets.\n\n💰 Price: Around $15–20 per dish\n🕐 Tip: Dine in if you can — the claypot crust doesn’t travel well!\n\nUpdate:\n\nThey’ve got BBQ now 🍢\nTried the chicken wings today — crispy on the outside, tender and juicy inside 🤤\nThe aroma hits you hard, and the flavor just keeps pulling you in!\nBest part? It’s super affordable!🔥\nPair it with a cold beer and you’ve got the perfect combo 🍻",

You can tell it’s been cooked with care — no dryness, no toughness, just pure, melt-in-your-mouth perfection with a light chicken aroma.\n\n🍚 Fragrant Chicken Oil Rice\nThe rice is hands-down one of the stars of the dish. Cooked in chicken broth and oil, each grain is separate and glistening with flavor. Honestly, I could eat a whole bowl of just the rice!\n\n🧄 The Holy Trinity of Sauces\nThe classic trio — ginger paste, chili sauce, and sweet soy sauce — were all spot on. Balanced, homemade-tasting, and they elevate the chicken to another level when mixed and matched.\n\n🥬 Bok Choy on the Side\nInstead of the usual cucumber, this place served lightly blanched bok choy. Crisp, vibrant, and soaking in just a hint of that savory chicken flavor — it was the perfect complement and added a homey touch.\n\n🍲 Comforting Soup Included\nA bowl of hot, clean-tasting chicken broth comes with the set — light but flavorful, and a lovely warm finish to the meal.\n\n📍 From the outside, this shop might not catch your eye. But take one bite of their Hainanese chicken rice and you’ll instantly know — this is the real deal. No hype, no frills, just honest, heartwarming food done really well. Definitely a hidden gem worth discovering.",

I had the Village Style Kleftiko and my wife had the Canterbury Lamb Platter, wow, I mean far out. The Kleftiko was absolutely stunning, so full of flavour and fall apart melt in your mouth chunks of lamb, we of course sampled each others and my wife's was stunning as well, she concurred. Of course we had to have dessert and this is what sets Costas apart from every other dinning experience I've ever had. You've just had a beautiful main and in our case an entre not to mention a couple of wines and you're beginning to feel a bit full but you'd like a dessert, something sweet to finish things off. Enter Costas mini desserts, what a brilliant idea, you don't have to pay the full price of a dessert and its just enough so you're not left with that I ate too much feeling. I had the Baklava Ice Cream and my wife had the Chocolate Mousse, both excellent. All in all, a fantastic experience, beautiful food, great atmosphere and good service. Highly recommend Costas, can't wait to go back.",

A lot of it is prepared and refrigerated. For example their crumbed food. This makes it not crispy and has a stale, soft texture to it. Even though they call it crispy chicken or crispy prawn.\n\nThey are frequently out of simple ingredients. INCLUDING RICE! What sushi shop runs out of rice.\n\nTheir kitchen closes really early. Used to be 2pm then 1:45pm and now 1:30pm. Which seems silly as that is lunch time. And the kitchen is fully closed on a Sunday.\n\nI've given up on this sushi shop.",

He was so kind and friendly, even taking the time to greet our 7-month-old baby boy with such a genuine smile. It really warmed our hearts.\n​We ordered the Hungry Man and Tattooed Lady. Wow! These beef burgers were absolutely massive and delicious – we could barely finish them! Such a satisfying meal.\n​Thank you, Akhil, for the wonderful welcome to your beautiful country.

My suggestion is when you get group bookings esp for Families put them in that space infront of the Dart Board because we didn't have to talk over each other and it's a perfect spot near the Big Screen where you can still enjoy a meal, drink and watch the sports. We set up the tables there.\n\nService is friendly but waited awhile ordering the platter for 2 off the smokehouse menu. The Waffle Fries and Sausage is what I enjoyed. Everyone's Burgers looked amazing I think they enjoyed them? You have to go to the bar and order your food. They don't have a person coming to your table to take orders.

I felt sorry for my husband as they just left what he could not eat off the plate and didn’t substitute it with anything else. The staff were lovely but when we are paying that price, I don’t expect them to be reading off a list what is on the plate and I felt sorry for our waitress as I had to show her how to open a bottle of wine as it had a cork in it, not her fault, she should have been trained, because she pocketed the cork and filled the glasses up with out letting us taste it first.\nIt took too long between courses, as they are very small, they need to come out faster - we were informed that the kitchen staff were overwhelmed - not sure why as you have to book and it is a set menu. Finally, pudding was not great, the honey cake tasted stale or had only just been taken out of the fridge and not brought up to room temperature\nThese small things would not normally make me out in a review but this should be a top experience",

We were told by our server it was 4 courses.\nUnfortunately we received only 2 dishes from the menu and the rest were off menu. Disappointing as if this was made clear to us we would've chosen to order separate to the trust the chef.\nSome of the dishes from off menu were great but the sides with the main were extremely simple and not worth the money paid. A bowl of simple roast potatoes that were undercooked on the inside with a sparse amount of bland sauce and a bowl of nearly plain lettuce leafs.\nOne of the dishes we received from the menu was the focaccia which was delicious but we got one small piece each which again doesn't seem worth the money (on the menu the focaccia is $13 so i assume that ordering it not as part of trust the chef you would receive a more generous portion)\nWe calculated how much it would have cost to order all the dishes we wanted from the menu and it would've actually worked out cheaper than doing trust the chef.\nWe were also never told and it does not say on the menu that dessert was included in trust the chef (it became clear to us that this would be the 4th course when the 3rd course delivered was the main) there were no desserts listed on the menu given us. Two issues here - the main one being that I wouldn't have ordered dessert and therefore didn't factor this in to the cost of our decision and I didn't eat it. Secondly the dessert given was very small - about a 1/5th portion of a normal slice of cake with a mini scoop of gelato. Again poor value for money. (but at least my partner could easily consume both given the size)\n\nIn saying this - the beef main we were given was delicious, the drinks were good, the service was excellent and the vibe of the restaurant is lovely.\n\nOur issue really is the value for money of the trust the chef and the poor reflection of the trust the chef compared to the menu - definitely give Odeon a try but my recommendation would be to order off the menu over doing the trust the chef.",

Portions are generally small.\n\nOther times have had poor experiences. Food can take forever to arrive on occasion. Need to constantly beg for drinks/refills, including those we had actually ordered - service is excruiatingly slow.\n\nIt doesn't seem as if the owners have experienced a real American diner.\n\nIt's too hard. The theme is great and we want to love it, but this is a terrible example of Christchurch hospitality. The quality of the average Christchurch cafe is much higher than this. We eat out a lot and just cannot recommend this to others in good faith. The theme is the drawcard but on arrival, they do not deliver on anything except the bill.",

The service was really good and the atmosphere was cosy and comfortable. All in all 5 stars. Here is everything we ate and enjoyed:\n1. Market fresh oysters (bluff oysters)\n2. Umami wagyu beef sliders\n3. Fried chicken\n4. Middle eastern lumina lamb stone baked flatbread\n5. Pork stone baked flatbread\n\nFor breakfast, we had the\n1. French toast - this is a must must try\n2. Hummus and bean quesadillas with poached eggs\n3. Avocado croissant with poached eggs4”\n4. Poached eggs with hollandaise sauce on a crispy potato pave - this was very heavy and can be avoided if you don’t want to take a nap!\n5. Fresh scones\n\nPlease note, the dinner menu is not available post 9pm (please confirm with the restaurant), so you will have to make do with the bar menu, which is what we did.\n\nThey also had a good collection of wine.",

The space is welcoming with a beautiful patio heated by wood burning fireplace and electric heaters. The staff is friendly and attentive. But the FOOD, y'all! Each thing we tried was creative, beautiful, and incredibly delicious. Tonight's fish was grouper and it was served 2 ways: fried and grilled - both absolutely stunning. The tomato and peach burratta caprese would have been delicious as is but was topped with basil ice cream instead of fresh basil and it was one of the most unexpectedly scrumptious things I've ever had. What a culinary gem!!!",

We were told no jugs for 30 minutes in a very rude and unwelcoming way, we waited 30 minutes and returned to be told no jugs at all, then asked if there are cocktails and were told “no cocktails while we are busy” which was silly because there was two people waiting to order a drink, and the bar itself didn’t even have all its seats filled. Honestly, just a rude experience when there was absolutely no need for the treatment we received. Where is the customer service?? As someone who has worked years in hospitality this was so unnecessary, people politely coming to order and being told “no” to every request without even a kind “no sorry we aren’t serving that anymore.” This is clearly a show of ageism, if not plain rudeness, with uni students being treated poorly for no reason whatsoever.",

The papadoms tasted like the ones from the supermarket and the pickled mango tasted off. Our samosas that we ordered were soft and obviously a bit old. One thing I noticed while walking towards the restaurant was that there were pieces of wet newspaper on the window covered in mold.

Charred, bitter, and completely inedible. One dish out of a four-dish order, sure — but the rest of the family ate while mine sat on the bench like a warning from the culinary gods.\n\nI called, thinking a refund for the burnt mess would be reasonable. Apparently not. Maybe they like their rice blackened to oblivion, but I prefer mine edible.\n\nWe used to order every week. I guess it’s pizza night from now on.",

There was also minimal flavour and sauce and while  I waited for the order in store, to be ready, it was actually lukewarm. It was very disappointing and an unpleasant meal but we were both tired and hungry from working all day, so we ate most of it.  We will not be returning even though we have been many times before.

Also had the situation multiple times when she has said to me ‘we have no more stock’ which seems to be dishonesty for when they are busy.

Bar Staff were friendly, drinks like wow budget friendly as we know places on the Terrace can charge your soul for drinks😭 Definitely recommend for all looking for this kind of vibe🤩🍸\n\nDid the Cocktail Lunch Club as a Pre Mothers Day and wow absolutely amazing experience. It's a 2 course lunch and they bring everything out to share that's on the menu and 5 cocktails per person. Great value for money.

While another colleague was already serving a customer who was ready to leave, she came back with my order and  interrupted them to engage in a personal conversation, even though the customer was already served. This meant that I was left waiting, even though she was not busy with another customer. When I tried to get her attention she’s just turned her back to me and pretend that she was doing something in the computer so I insist  politely multiple times (five or six times), she continued to ignore me and refused to provide the manager’s name or assist further, stating that the manager wouldn’t be available until Sunday. This behavior is unacceptable and reflects poorly on customer service standards. No one should be treated this way, and it truly ruined my day.",

A word of advice tho...make sure to either order in advance or avoid during lunch as the place gets pretty swamped making wait times super long as it is only a small kitchen.",
