Now... the food. Epic. Seasonal. Simple. Divine. I started with their marinated tomato salad which was fresh and flavorful. Entree was the steak with potato, onion rings and veggies - absolutely incredible. Naturally I had to save room for dessert and landed on the vanilla crème brûlée (though all the options sounded amazing). It came with fresh fruit and pistachio biscotti and was a great way to round out the meal. 

I would come back here again and again and again. Bravo!!",2,"Denver, CO",0,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Z583nOzi9vc0X5O1HyW2gA

The food is okay I guess. I was way too hyped about it so it was a bit let down that the food didn't live up to my hype. It wasn't the restaurants fault. The service is really good.

The food tasted great but the portions were exceeding small. I got the lamb rack which was four pieces, each with meat about the size of a cherry tomatoe (see picture). There was a small serving of potatoes and a meatball as well with veggies. At $42, it was definitely overpriced. I have had bigger portions at about half the price for the same taste elsewhere in NZ.

During our visit to Christchurch we found several interesting places to eat and wanted to make our last night special by choosing this locally well rated restaurant. 

As the name suggests, you enter by climbing 27 steps to find a very small space with minimalist furnishings of very simple tables and chairs. A small complete bar is to your right as you enter - we were quickly seated at a postage stamp sized table. The menu is basically what the chef fancies to prepare for dinner - so on-line menus just list items that are basic rather than recommended for each evening. I enjoy one of the best prepared filet Mignons I have eaten in a long time and shared some of my wife's risotto and a house made bread to make a wonderful tasting meal! Although they were very busy, our server took her time with us to ensure we got the best of what they had to offer - including a very tasty Pinot Noir fro the region.

I know it can be tiring working in hospitality but we did not feel like valued customers even though we were paying the $$$ prices. We were hurried through our entree and main, and the request of dessert was hurried. We said no to dessert as we weren't ready, and the bill immediately came to the table. We hadn't finished our drinks and felt like we were just being pushed out the door. We had a reservation by the way, 6pm, Sunday night. Hardly a peak busy night where they are trying to turn people through quickly. Otherwise service was prompt and ""polite"" enough. But not warm or inviting. 
Anyway - if you've made it this far - the food was so lovely! I had pan seared scollops with pork belly and a perfectly cooked beef fillet with potato gratin.

The chef prepares interesting, locally sourced masterpieces paired with an excellent wine list.  The two appetizers (entrees for our friends from everywhere else) we chose were a scallop special and the calamari. Both were creative, smart and delicious.  The mains were a special risotto of pears and spring onions and ricotta that tasted so much like freshness on a plate, and the venison special, which melted in our mouths.  Dessert (embarrassing, I know, that we kept eating) was a blood orange crème brûlée that we just couldn't resist. Service was attentive and fun. Decor is minimal and chic. Get here.

The star of the show was the Rib Eye with duck fat and horseradish cream; I have lived in the Midwest US for the past 5 years and I thought it was in definite competition with steak I have had in the meat Mecca, which is saying a lot.

The most delicious part of our meal was the chargrilled chicory, cauliflower, dates with a coconut yogurt (tasted like lemon ricotta cheese) and organic greens.  

We also had the soup or the day - which was yam with spinach and buttermilk topped with amazing pesto. Delicious and warm - perfect for a cold night. We alsohad the special appetizer of the day - scallops with chorizo. The scallops were a tad small - but I always feel like restaurants overcharge for scallops - so this was somewhat to be expected.

They start you off with a thick piece of herby bread and butter and a jug of lemon water. To drink I tried a glass of the ""skin ferment"" wine, which I'd never heard of, but the servers insisted it was worth a try. It has a reddish orangey color, kind of like rum punch. And it tastes a bit like fruit juice or cider. It wasn't bad! I don't know that I would order it again with dinner, but it could be a fun drink-outside-with-your-friends wine, like rosé's cousin.

For dinner I went with the herb crusted salmon over a bed of roasted potatoes, tomatoes, and capers. It was pretty good, but I wasn't able to finish it. The salmon portion was huge and it was just drenched in herbs; too much for my taste. The potatoes and tomatoes were on point though!

Service is friendly, but slow. It took awhile for my order to be taken, and my wine came after my food.

I'm not a big lamb fan but when my fiancé got it, I had to try. It was cooked well, melt in your mouth, and not overly lamby. I know that sounds weird but I find lamb has a very strong, pungent taste.

To begin, the decor is adorable and welcoming; the staff is super friendly and attentive; and the seating is comfortable and cozy. 

I sat alone, but had great conversation with the different staff. One of my servers discussed my wine tastes before letting me try two before settling on a glass. Both of her picks were spot on AND she let me know that a bottle was open that was not normally open so I could try a glass of that, as well. Really great service there. 

Let's start with the bread- homemade heaven with butter. Crumbles in your mouth. I don't normally eat bread- this bread is bomb.

I was having trouble deciding on the menu since everything that was delivered near me looked and smelled amazing. 

I settled on the roasted red capsicum tomato and red onion soup with got cheese, terragon and lemon creme fraiche. While not a fan of goat cheese (AT ALL) this was a delight hunt of flavor in a wonderful soup. It's light and creamy but still satisfying and bursting with flavor. They also let me get a *teacup* size since I didn't want to ruin my appetite on the starter. 

For the main, I chose the Pan fried salmon with capers, garlic crush potatoes, summer veg, and a banana prawns + lobster Marie Rose sauce topped with a cucumber salsa. The salmon fell apart on my plate. Even the roasted tomatoes on the side were amazing. 

I've had salmon 4 times while traveling NZ- this one takes the cake by far. This meal was fabulous and a great way to close out my New Zealand adventure.",43,"Dallas, TX",1,1,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YGcUF64YqnvQb9kwGLth2A

While cool, we opted to eat outside and it was perfect.  We both chose the fried chicken burger. It came with fries.  Sounds simple and boring, but no, it was amazing.  The burger was not, I believe, a single piece of chicken breast. It seemed to be various nice pieces of well trimmed chicken that had been, with the help of cheese, formed into a patty and then breaded and fried. It was topped with thinly sliced pickled onions, like the pink ones you get in Mexico, mild dill pickle and thinly sliced red chilies.  It was not super spicy hot, but perfectly spiced up the sandwich. Wonderful!  The fries were simply amazing.  Thick cut and freshly prepared, they were served with a bowl of large grain sea salt on the side along with a small container of ketchup.  I'm not sure what had been added to the ketchup, but it had a very unique and very tasty combination that complimented the fries as well.   The burgers were NZ $22 each (US 15) and worth every penny.  We had an amazing New Zealand Riesling from Pegasus Bay winery near Christchurch.  It's famous winery & top rated Riesling.  So depending on what you want for a beverage will determine your bill, but for us, this place was great value for money and a very memorable tasty lunch",6,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=g0me9jNTATGzpQaLg9SCPA

We were only in Christchurch for a few hours before our flight back to Auckland and stopped here based on reviews. It. Was. Amazing. Best meal of the two week trip through Auckland, Queenstown, Rotorua, and Wellington. We've been to several of the ""Best Of..."" restaurants on this trip and there was only one other place (Charley Noble in Wellington) that was even close to as good as 5th street. We sat at the Chefs Table which made everything even better because Samson served us and he's one of the co-owners and lead chefs crafting the menu. Such a great dude, and his team is really doin the Lord's work over here. We had four cocktails (Mezcal Milkpunch, Spritz 2x, and the Stirred). The lead bartender is a blast as well and is coming up with some truly delicious, refreshing drinks on this ever-changing menu (so I hear). We got the broccolini, the beef with pickled ginger, potatoes, and the true gem of the meal = the lamb shoulder. The lamb melts in your mouth. Do not hesitate for a second to order it even if you're not a big red meat eater! I'm sitting here at the airport not an hour removed from dinner and I had to write this review because of the lamb AND the quality of service. Props to Samson, Chris, and the third mustached musketeer / co-owner for creating such a memorable dining experience. And if you're wondering, ""is this guy still buzzed from the drinks he ordered at dinner?"" The answer is ""Hell yes. I couldn't NOT order a 4th cocktail.""

Near city centre with hotels and other restaurants near by.

Food  

International and inspired.  There is Asian, American and more represented on the menu. There are small, medium, and large plates to choose from.  We ordered pan fried shrimp, broccolini and kale, crispy potatoes, the tomahawk steak, and the risotto. We enjoyed all of it. We also had some sort of deconstructed lemon pie with a divine lemon ice cream.

Atmosphere/decor  

The space is very green in more ways than one.  It's literally filled with plants and green decorations.  Beautiful lighting.  Hipster vibe.

Service  

No issues here.  We sat at the 'chef's table' which is really 4 bar seats in front of the kitchen. This made the experience for us! The sous chef spoke with us and  answered questions all while doing his job of cooking.  He also let us try the zucchini fritters on the house. Outstanding gesture! He takes all your orders personally and you can see the chefs cooking your meal and then it is present directly to you.

The breakfast is pretty hearty.  I had the 2 eggs with toast.  I asked for the eggs over medium; however, they came out over easy.  I figured it was just lost in translation.  Overall, the eggs were a little too underdone for me, but the toast was very good.  I also had the mango/coconut smoothie which was very coconut forward, which I enjoyed.

We did arrive early around 5:30pm so the place was quiet and we received attention promptly.  Try a glass of Cloudy Bay Brut! Excellent and better than some much higher priced bubbly I've had. Or the Daquiri which has a nice hint of cinnamon.  We had pork wontons which were served golden brown and hot with a sweet and savoury dipping sauce.  Then we had the Kung Pao Chicken (perfectly spiced and made with a rich dark soy base) and a Vegetarian Pad Thai...beware the chilies on the side are potent.  A side of rice and a few beers and all was great.  Friendly and attentive service also.  One of our favourite meals in New Zealand.,9,"Ottawa, Canada",0,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=axR_0IIPZz04oC3_ntuDXw

My family of four descended on this place, and did, I think, a great job of ordering (with a little advice from a very helpful waiter). We had crispy skin chicken: delicious, moist and tender with delicate crisp skin, great spices, and an insane vinegar broth to dip in. There was duck breast in red curry: nice thick, spicy sweet coconut curry, tender duck breast with good flavor, and not too much fat, plus nice peppers and veggies besides. And we did Szechuan lamb, which, honestly, was not very Szechuan, if you ask me? But was pretty delicious. Tender, good flavor and not gamey, good sauce. Just missing some Szechuan heat, or that tingly Szechuan peppercorn flavor I love so much. And we finished that all off with some of their sauteed greens. The American in me reads that to be ""wilted spinach"" - no thanks - but it's more Asian greens, more substantial than just wilted leaf lettuce, and they're quite nice. Fresh 
tasting, crisp and not overcooked, nice stir fry sauce. An easy choice to accompany any dish if you're hungry for some greens, these kind of hit the spot.

Broken record - price very reasonable for what we got. Service was very friendly too. If you're looking for Asian in Christchurch, this is definitely worth checking out.",10,"Aurora, IL",2,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tPufvUuxXLJOMYQ7gzsMVA

So it's not authentic Cantonese, Vietnamese, Malaysian, Singaporean, Korean or Thai.  What it is... a fusion of Asian flavors with local proteins and ingredients.  And in that sense of flavor spirit they do just fine thank you, dojei, kham Sam me da, khap Khun ma khap.  Strong bold and spicy flavors with generous NZ portions (in Asia they would be half the size).  No disrespect intended, but you can only eat so much Fish and Chips and lamb roast.    So a night or meal of a different flavor from another mother is a nice accent to the forever weekly manja monotone.  It ain't any one Asian food profiles but a melange of flavors.   And 9,000 or 12,000 km from the home country it's all good!

Deep fried Pork hock was outstanding!  With lettuce wraps and mayo/rice and Kim Chee purée?  Different take and One hock portion, needs one tummy plus to make this go away.  Clams with homemade XO?  Your got to be gutsy to pull this off.  And it works in a kiwi kind of way.  Even straight up chicken wings are as finger licking good as creamy spiced mayo dip can make it. Decent wine list with a thoughtful stab at a cocktail list.  We do agree service was a bit spotty, but in contrast to two other Sunday dining rooms that were empty this place was busy.   And we all know Sunday restaurant labor is a bit pricey to find.  So just order quick and think ahead for your next drink.  Be proactive with your ordering and enjoy a busy restaurant.  The kitchen rocks with a well timed wok and food comes quick and you just need to add your own lick!   Chefs here definitely have their groove on.

It was tangy, but not too much, and delicious. The chef in this restaurant is fantastic. 

We were full with these items but if you are extra hungry you'll probably want to add in another appetizer or another meal to share. We were not too hungry as our eating schedule was off kilter due to traveling and time zones.

I hate dining windows but understand why a busy restaurant insists on them. I do give KoS credit for letting us know about it when making the reservation though - at two recent restaurants I have been to we were evicted from out seats with no warning before even getting to desserts! 

I have to comment on the decor, which is amazing. The wallpapers are bright and vivd and really add to the ambience of the place. Food is asian fusion style. Definitely order the spinach leaf wrap things, they are one of my favourite things on the menu. Its an incredible mouthful of fresh bursting flavour. The dumplings in broth are disappointing and bland. Other dishes I enjoyed are the moong dal salad and the penang curry. I normally avoid ordering dessert at asian style restaurants but took a gamble on the mango tart tartin. It was pretty good if not mind-blowing.

Ionara (Brazilian by her accent) excelled in ensuring that my evening was unpleasant. I made the unfortunate error of enthusiastically ordering two entrees so that I could experience as much as possible. Unfortunately I was not informed that all meals are designed to be shared. As I was dining alone (on a business trip) it became apparent I would not be able to handle the two large entrees and a main. I politely requested that one of my untouched entrees be returned.

Ionara proceeded to inform me in no uncertain terms that as I had ordered the meal, my options were to pay for it and take it away or leave it and still pay for it. Her demeanour was rude and unapologetic.

I don't think hospitality was a particularly prudent choice of career for this hostess and King of Snake would be well advised to take heed.

Modern, casual yet elegant is the definition of the interior.  The oyster starters were just perfectly briny morsels that were contrasted well with the black pepper vinaigrette.  This begged us to move on to the mandarin marinated tuna which in the hands of lesser cooks could be a textural disaster, but here it is firm yet infused well with the marinade, the pumpkin yellow curry was a wonderful amalgamation of thai flavors and a touch of Indianness with the cashews and the stir fried cumin lamb a fantastic meaty meal with bits of char on the lamb from the high heat stir fry working well with the toasty almost mild pungency of the cumin. This dish reminded me of a similar dish I had in Beijing and invoked a flood of memories of that trip, yet took me in a new direction.  A nice wine list rounds off this place.

Right across the street was an interesting looking cafe/pub place. It was cool and blustery, and we wanted something warming.  Wow! Did this place deliver!  Super friendly staff welcomed us.  As it was Sunday, many were there for brunch.  I saw many plates with eggs and other goodies that looked great.  But we were here for lunch.  My husband had a pie stuffed with smoked pork that he said was delicious.  It came with a pea purée and lovely salad. I chose the pappardelle with lamb ragout and white bean purée.  The shredded lamb was a delight and the sauce was light and flavorful with a hint of Moroccan spice, but light. The top of the food had some shavings of cheese and what appeared to be radish sprouts.  It was lush and unctuous with a marvelous taste and texture.  Perfect comfort food for such cool, damp late summer day.  The bean purée was a simple foil with hint of the spice I mentioned, or was that the only place where it was?  I'm not sure, but it was yummy.  We had a nice bottle of central Otago Pinot noir which was nicely acidic that was nice food wine and matched our meals perfectly.  The meal with the wine, which was over 50% of the bill, came to US $75.

The chalkboard said it was served with toasted brioche, pickled vegetables, and citrus mayo. So, imagine my surprise when it came in an egg patty!

I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. It was okay, but you really couldn't taste the fish - mostly egg. I pried a fish to taste by itself, but the egg was too overpowering. I think since this is a seasonal fish, the fish should be showcased. Without the citrus mayo, this would've been a bland dish 

I learned from the waitress that this fish is always served in the form of a patty with something else.

Dining solo presented a challenge as I could only sample one meal. Judging off of previous Yelp comments and my desire to try local, I went with the Canterbury Lamb Shoulder. 
Having nothing else on the menu to compare it to, I certainly vouch for this dish. You won't be disappointed. Served on a bit of greens and topped with a fruit sauce, the lamb, which had obviously been stewing for awhile, was super tender and extremely flavorful. In addition to its succulence, the portion was quite substantial! Adding a side of baby spinach salad and a Black Dog draft beer ensured I had no room for dessert. 
Peeking at the table next to me, another customer had ordered the salmon. Based on appearance and the clean plate after 15 minutes, I'd guess that dish also comes recommended.

We started with the fried chicken appetizer and it was so dry that the only thing that made it edible was the sauce it came with. Next we ordered the feast, and it included a salad, lamb, roasted onions, peas, stuffed mushrooms, and two sides that included duck fat potatoes, and another salad. The lamb was cold and flavorless. It seemed like the chef had no idea how to cook lamb. Both salads were boring and also flavorless, but the most memorable dish was the potatoes. The duck fat potatoes were the hardest, most dry dish of potatoes I have ever seen in my life. The were impossible to chew because they were rock solid. How on earth do you mess up potatoes?? They're the world's easiest food to cook. Additionally, the portions were tiny for the supposed ""feast"" title. We both left so hungry, and had to order pizza later that evening to make up for it. I want to point out that before we got our food, the couple sitting next to us complained about their meal, so it wasn't just a matter of our taste buds. I will say that the waiter was very nice and the service was good, but I went for the food and the high ratings I saw on Google. It was also $95, including a drink each, and did not include dessert.

We arrived fairly early, around 5:30PM on a Sunday, and the dining room was nearly empty, but did  start to fill within an hour or so.  

The wine list featured a lot of reasonably priced New Zealand selections; we were very happy with our Rockface Pinot Noir.   We shared an order of pumpkin hummus as a starter, which was good, and the perfect amount for the three of us to have just a little nibble before entrees.   I had the lamb shoulder which was excellent!   It was very tender and flavorful, and the potatoes, kale, and sauces all went with it perfectly.  A family member also had the lamb, and, unfortunately, one of his two pieces of lamb had a large chunk of fat, but he did enjoy it despite that!  Another family member had the fish special, and she said it was delicious!  It came with fried whitebait as a topping.  Given that this was our first night in New Zealand, we really didn't know what whitebait was....for others who are equally ignorant, it is exactly what it sounds like...tiny bait fish!  These were fried up nice and crispy, and we all tried some...just don't think about it too much, or look too closely at them, and they are quite tasty!   

Dessert was good, but not quite what we expected; all the desserts are served in a deconstructed style which, honestly, isn't a favorite of mine.   

Service was excellent.  Our server was friendly, and knew the menu well.  We were seated in a porch-like area that was delightful - bright with lots of greenery!

We showed up pretty late - around 8:45 in the evening on a Sunday - and while the restaurant still had several tables when we came in, it was virtually deserted by the time we had finished. The restaurant has a modern feel to it, and while it is also a bar, the noise from the television didn't really intrude on the dining space at all. The service was solid at best, with it taking a bit long to place our order at the start and to get the check at the end. While there are some local beers available for order, the one I had (Pointer's Pale Ale) was one of the weakest offerings I've had in that genre of beer. My wife was less than impressed that flavored iced teas were the only option available in that kind of drink.

As for the food, I would say that the the bread was arguably the best part of the meal. It tasted like it was all cooked in-house and was warm and fresh. The wheat bread in particular had warmth and fluffiness to it that you would not take from how it was presented (as sliced triangles, like it would be for a sandwich). The butter was also very rich and worked very well with bread as soft as what was served. For an appetizer, we split the seared scallops. While the salsa verde worked very well as a complement to the scallops (which were prepared pretty well), the pickled fennel was a bit of a dissonant note and added too much acidity to the salsa. The entrees were also a bit on the inconsistent side. My wife's lamb shoulder fell apart quite easily, and it had very good smoky flavor - especially paired with the dahl - but paradoxically, the meat itself was also too dry - very little succulence with any bite. After my first choice was dk'ed (the king salmon), I went with the pork belly noodle soup. The pork belly was very juicy and flavorful, and the glass noodles were also pretty solid as well. However, the broth had a very muddled flavor, really making the soup more of a conveyance vehicle for the rest of the dish, as opposed to adding anything to the dish.

Overall, Fiddlesticks is a nice spot to take in a meal, but I was not blown away by it. The lamb was surprisingly overcooked, and while some of the fusion elements of the dishes were good (e.g. the dahl), others missed the mark. As a tourist from the other side of the world, I would probably check out another restaurant in Christchurch next time I am in town first.",27,"New York, NY",1,0,1,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CJmtS1Uk1KSsY2MWol_E7g

The food presentation is stellar, a real feast for the eyes. Most of the food lived up to its looks with the exception of the whitebait patty which the eater felt was a little sparse on the whitebait, heavy on the egg. The fried chicken entree was raved about. My beef fillet was good although I asked for rare and everyone agreed it looked more med-rare. The highlight of it was the proscuitto fries which were very morish, and make up for the fact that  Quality of all the meats was top notch though. The fresh fish was absolutely divine, and the venison feast received two thumbs up (well four technically since its a shared dish!). The chocolate truffle dessert was outstanding, a real highlight of the meal for me. The salted caramel dessert was less spectacular but still good. 

I thought service was above average - friendly, attentive, good humoured. The only small letdown was we were not asked if we wanted another round of drinks which we probably would have gone for if we had been asked, but weren't worried about enough to attract the attention ourselves. He also went to a lot of effort to bill us separately for our individual meals as we requested, even though this is a lot more work for him.  

There is a lot of seating options in this restaurant including some nice outdoorsy areas which are perfect for summer evenings. I liked the decor, it was fresh and green and welcoming.

I had an expertly cooked steak with mustard and pickled vegetables and some specially prepared ""fries"" and a side of broccoli, the later unfortunately was a little over cooked for me; a very enjoyable meal",34,Australia,1,1,1,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2BKqNWXvukhZdq6_8Gbfxg

We were seated on the back patio -- a covered open-air patio with limited seating. We ordered a lot of food including the red chili fish in broth, a tempura style cauliflower, scallion pancakes, mapo tofu, veggie gyoza (dumplings) and the veggie stir-fry noodles. The food comes out as it's ready, and dishes are great for sharing. This works out well for a long meal, except that our noodles came out about 20 minutes after the rest of the food (and we were about ready to leave). We ended up taking that whole dish to go (takeaway) after it was served. 

My personal favorite was the chili fish -- the broth was spicy and delicious -- but everything on the menu was great!",1,"Madison, WI",0,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PFbJeXfBYa4IyD-0mGYLAg

Actually, we then got to people-watch as they passed by on the street, while viewing the activity at the restaurant, as well.

With the menu offerings focused on pizzas and pastas, we both chose to start with a pear-and-gorgonzola salad, with toasted focaccia for the table. The salad greens were perfectly dressed, and the pears had just the right amount of crunch. I would have preferred a bit more gorgonzola, but I'm quite a cheese lover.

The duck ragu risotto was fantastic. The risotto was cooked perfectly al dente, and the rich flavors of the ragu and texture of the duck crackling pieces on top were fantastic. Just note that the portion is large, and two people could easily share one serving of this rich risotto.

There's a nice wine selection, with offerings from New Zealand and Italy.

Not surprisingly many restaurants were closed for the holiday so we were searching for places on Yelp and calling the ones that seemed appealing. Luckily for us, Francesca's was open.

We came here for a relatively early dinner and were able to get street parking. The restaurant itself is a quite larger open space, while I can't say it stood out appearance wise, it was definitely pleasant looking. We were seated almost immediately and considering that the rest of the city seemed to be abandoned, it was pretty lively in here.

The menu has a decent amount of options, we usually order a bruscheta to start but didn't feel like it this time around so we just went with mains. I ordered the Pasta Norma (tomato, chili, capers, goats cheese, pecorino with casareccia pasta) while he went with the House made potato gnocchi (braised Wakanui beef cheeks, gremolata, pecorino). I enjoyed my dish a lot, it was fresh and flavorful.

Within a few minutes, our token number was called out and the pizza was served.

Luckily, they were close to our hotel, because we had to check back a couple times to catch them at a time when they were open (4-8). Other than some novelty shirts and sausage, they only sell one thing: lamb shoulder with scalloped potatoes and you can buy bread baguettes. 

The sales guy was great, even showed us the plate of food so we could understand sizing, and recommended bread for soaking up the juice. The lamb is so tender, almost like a pot roast, with a lovely, crispy exterior. The potatoes are not as cheesy as scalloped potatoes I've had in the past, but they accompany the lamb very well. Definitely get the bread...because soaking up the juice is the best part!

If you mistook this place for a place that screws around, then you would be mistooken. They most certainly do not. Pedro knows what the people want, and what they want is a big ol' lamb shoulder + potatoes, bathed in the juices, paired with either a top quality brew from an establishment like 8 Wired, Epic, Renaissance, Tuatara, or Liberty, or a top quality pinot noir from Central Otago. That is it. You do not need anything else on the menu, or in life. (Maybe tacos occasionally, and a good episode of ""Game of Thrones"")

If you're by yourself like me, aimlessly roaming around New Zealand as Bob Dylan would say ""Like a Rolling Stone"" (in my case I like to picture myself as Mick Jagger), and you go here, be hungry. Very hungry. There's one meal you can get here. It's enormous, and it's $40. Want something else? Something smaller? On a diet? Vegan? If so, the only thing to do is GTFO and STFU. The guy there pegged me as a morbidly obese McDonald's-gruffling American even though I'm only a slightly overweight taco-gruffling American, and he said I could probably finish it all. Dude thinks we're all Joey Chestnut. I'm not, so it lasted two meals. May last more than two for you if you're not American and/or not fat.

The first night we tried coming here we found that the lamb was already sold out- the owner kindly told us that it'd behoove us to call in an order for the next day (which was the last day of our trip in NZ).  We did so, and picked up a HUGE leg of lamb and a large tray of potatoes for ~$50 NZD.  The leg was more than enough to feed my parents, my wife, and me.

We were lucky to get in on this Thursday night, the place was busy but I was lucky as my concierge pulled some strings and got us a cute table for two right in front of the window overlooking the garden.  A prime location, indeed!

Service was a bit slow which is why not the perfect score, but that may have been due to the fact that the place was very busy as it was a holiday the next day.

While they are known for their Spanish tapas, their menu has a pretty wide range.  Depending on how you want to eat, you can order a range of tapas to share as your dinner or a couple of tapas to begin with and then a couple of mains.  We chose to do the latter.

First up, we split the charcuterie plate.  This thing was huge and came with several kinds of meat as well as some bruschetta to enjoy it in.  We also had the lamb tapas which also was perfect for sharing.

For my main, I went with the lamb shoulder special of the day which was super tasty and very tender.  My friend wanted a steak and his came out perfectly prepared as well.

The ambiance is cute and the food is very good.  I also liked that the location allows for a stroll before or after dinner in the beautiful botanical gardens.  Dinner with drinks for two ran about $168 which was really reasonable given the quantity of food we consumed.

Post-EQ I would say its a lovely place to come for drinks when the sun is shining. The outdoor area overlooking the park is amazingly relaxing on a warm summers afternoon/evening. 

Last time I ate here though I have to say I was quite disappointed. There was a group of 6 of us and the meals were nothing special. Two of the steaks which had been requested medium-rare were in fact very well done and chewy and not so nice to eat, bordering on inedible. We debated saying anything as all of us are quite non-confrontational but one of us took up the baton and made the waiter aware! He ended up comping some desserts but I couldn't recommend this place on food alone. Although the chocolate mousse was good, the rest of the food was underwhelming. Maybe we hit the chef on a  bad day? 

I probably won't be back for dinner, unless someone else makes the reservations.

It's a fun set of restaurants with several choices in different styles.  Getting a seat is pretty competitive, we had to orbit a bit to get a spot to sit.

There's also a Malaysian restaurant just outside.  I've had very good burgers and pizza here, and I would definitely come again for those or to try more of the excellent-looking places.

There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, but the large crowds here do mean that these fill up.

I ordered two takeaway waffles, one with vanilla icecream, and one with matcha icecream. After waiting about 30 minutes for my order, I asked how long it would take and was told it was ""on it's way"", however about 10 minutes later, an employee approached me and asked what I had ordered. After telling her I ordered two waffles, she proceeded to look around and then come back only to say that they would get them started. About 10 minutes later I was handed a bag with the two waffles and the icecream, and when I opened it, there was no matcha. At this point I had waited 50 minutes for two $12 waffles and one of the orders wasn't even correct. The waffles also seemed undercooked and soggy.

The employees were nice enough to add popcorn and some syrups because of how long we'd been waiting, but it definitely doesn't make up for everything.

I understand that when working with food it is easy for orders to be forgotten and occasionally messed up but I'm just very sad.

To boot, when not ordered takeaway, it comes with a waffle cone, but there was no waffle cone. It would just be nice to be told that there is no waffle cone if you order it take away.

I am let down because all of my previous experiences at eightgrains have been wonderful, and after this I am unsure if I would return.

Bacon Bros Burgers are located INSIDE 'The Little High Eatery' which has multiple fine eating establishments.  It's on High Street, but it's a little hard to find because you're looking for the Bacon Bros sign which is hidden, so look for the 'The Little High Eatery' sign (see the picture I posted...)  The whole eatery is more like OFF an alley off High Street and is easily obscured by some taller buildings.  Doesn't matter, FIND IT, it's worth it.

'The Little High Eatery' has about a dozen really cool, bohemian, artesian places.  Always better to support local than chains, go get out of Bubba Gump or the Olive Garden, and go to Bacon Bros.  Seriously kickin' burger, cooked perfectly, all the ingredients were fresh, the brioche bun soft but slightly chewy at the same time, and some nice slab bacon on top.  Very reasonably priced.

BSHdYzRKE3G-rcoxu2Xdeg,recommended,Ed L.,4,2018-09-26T03:02:10Z,"To celebrate my 39th birthday, I found this restaurant called Orleans here in Christchurch, New Zealand. I did enjoy cajun and creole soul food from the USA, so it was a perfect dining option. Plus, it was a couple of blocks from the hotel.

Turning 39 years overseas was interesting, since the time zone difference in the USA was a day earlier, so it allowed me to celebrate twice. With that said, I arrived here at the Orleans restaurant and bar around 8pm on a brisk Monday evening in mid September 2018. I thought initially that the restaurant itself was closed, since there was construction going on the opposite side of the street, not realizing that the restaurant was on the other side. To my relief, I was okay and entered the restaurant. I almost had cut my losses and tried to find somewhere else in walking distance, but thankful that I had found the restaurant. During my visit here to the Orleans restaurant, it was typically Monday night in the city. I guess I came in when the dinner rush was largely over and found a group of people finishing up and leaving, letting me having the entire restaurant and bar to myself. The ambiance here was very casual and basically what you'd find in a bar setting. 

The overall experience here at Orleans restaurant and bar was nice and quiet. Kind of like the casual attitude of the place and didn't like the loud noises when coming to such places. Maybe I'm getting old and like quiet places. Either way, Orleans was nice and cozy. I dig the decor and the service was nice, friendly, and fast, even for a place that was slowing down for the night. They told me they were closing at 9pm, but the yelp page said till 12 midnight. Probably need to change it sooner or later. With that said, celebrating a birthday here with southern comfort food was nice and definitely one to remember. While I was dining alone, it was nice and pleasant. Orleans restaurant and bar is located at 89 Litchfield Street in the heart of downtown Christchurch, New Zealand. They offer live music, but during the night I was there, there was no live music. Probably on the weekends or something. They accept major credit cards, usually Visa, which are usually a great thing for us tourist folk who live on the plastic. 

Not sure about parking, although street parking is your best bet. I'm not from Christchurch, but I walked it here during my holiday in mid September 2018. Hotel was nearby and I had a craving for New Orleans type of cuisine. I'm sure Christchurch's public transportation can get you here too. There's always uber, which is nice. I ended up spending an hour here, enjoying my meal and soaking up the fact that I am not 38 anymore. It's kind of disappointing, but that's life. For my meal, I ended up getting a po boy sandwich, which is basically standard for any southern style delight. Along with that, i ordered some curly fries, which ended up being some sort of regular fries curled up and spiced up to taste differently from your Burger King type fries. I finished it up with an order of sweet ice tea. I should have gotten liquor, but I figured I'll celebrate with that later on. The po boy itself was good and tasteful. It was delicious and harmoniously hit the spot after a long day of travel from Sydney, Australia. The fries were surprisingly epic and the sweet tea was interesting. With the restaurant closing earlier than I thought, I opted to get dessert elsewhere.

Prices here were okay. Their menu was surprisingly and shockingly limited, but I guess that's how it is sometimes. Although the food ordered and the ambiance was pretty good, I thought for an place that served Cajun / Creole USA cuisine should have more items. 3.5 stars for the overall experience. 4.0 stars for the ambiance and the food. 3.5 stars for the service.

BSHdYzRKE3G-rcoxu2Xdeg,recommended,Nathaniel A.,5,2018-08-05T05:44:56Z,First time trying Orleans in Christchurch. Food was very tasty. The waffle stack was delicious and a great share. The beetroot salad was light and refreshing. We then tried the cheesecake sample and the Orleans Beignets which are incredible!

BSHdYzRKE3G-rcoxu2Xdeg,recommended,Michayla C.,1,2018-03-11T03:06:46Z,"I used to go here a lot when it first opened, mainly around 2015-2016. When Orleans first opened they had a fantastic menu that was simple yet delicious. Their food was always hot and on time and they worked to a ""first come first serve basis"" without taking reservations for parties smaller than 6. 

Last night me and my Mum went back to find we were not able to sit in the restaurant because they were ""fully booked"". Obviously this was our fault for not researching it however I'm disappointed they have changed they way they run things. They did offer to give us food if we sat at any of the bars in Stranges' Lane (three other establishments). This sounds like it would work however after our experience, theres evidence it does not. 

We decided to stay and sit in Capa (which used to be Vespa) We looked at the menu to find that our favorite classic dishes/ sides were gone e.g no Po boys, mac'n'cheese or cornbread as well as the fact that we couldn't order a jug of lunch as we used to before. Instead we ordered two gin cocktails, overpriced for what they were- watered down, juice like cocktails, not nearly as good as we expected from this establishment. We ordered chicken and waffles and pork belly as well as a side of grilled cheese cornbread. The food took almost 40 mins to arrive, we then had to wait an extra 5 mins for cutlery. The food had clearly been sitting out as the kumara mash on the pork belly was stone cold, the pork belly was extremely chewy and impossible to eat the pork crackle. The chicken was warm, not hot and the waffle was soggy as the syrup had been sitting on it for ages. The grilled cheese was hot however the basic recipe was flawed- cornbread on its own is meant to be sweet bread as a side. When you add cheese or jalapeños (which this had) it overpowers the cornbread - basically rendering it just bread. Whoever decided to change this recipe - I really don't think they've had/ appreciated southern American cornbread before. Overall it was extremely disappointing - which we expressed to the staff at Capa. He offered us two more drinks but at that stage we just wanted to leave. We would expect this sort of service and food at a cheap takeaways however we expected a semi-fine dining experience as we had two years earlier and it was definitely not worth the $61 we paid for in our final bill. 

It's my opinion that management has changed the fundamentals that made this restaurant so great. Their kitchen may be able to handle food service for four bars in Stranges' Lane but their staff certainly can't. As we left we found another couple visiting from Australia who were also disappointing in their cold food and said it had been the worse meal they had, had in New Zealand. It makes me angry enough that a great restaurant in christchurch has been changed for the worse and I have wasted money, but to have it be a poor representation to the tourists this city dearly needs, that makes me rope-able. I won't be coming back again. And I dearly hope they change their system and menu back to how it was or least find a way to improve.",6,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JWC3N4urL3C0Ek5OwEbu6A

Conveniently situated next to Strange's Lane in the most hip area to come back since the quakes, Orleans flawlessly blends New Orleans soul food with the Kiwi hospitality. If you visit this establishment, bookings are not accepted for groups under 8, so be sure to arrive early. Around 8 pm the place is crawling with hungry (and thirsty) patrons. For imbibing, I recommend the Hurricane pitcher to share or the Dr. Pepper Martini. For food, you'll absolutely kick yourself if you don't order their chicken and waffles with a honey glaze. It's simply perfect, and a moderate portion size so you're not too stuffed to order and additional side or dessert (which must be the cookie sandwich). I love their curly fries, but if you need something healthier, the burnt cauliflower is fantastic (and not burnt, dispite the name).

Though there aren't many spaces, it was nice not to have to fight street parking. We entered through the back patio door which leads onto a covered, cozy patio great for enjoying a beer with a friend on a warm day. The restaurant inside is dark and rustic, but the bar is aglow with the colorful chalkboard promoting the beers on tap that day. We spent some time with the bartender discussing the beers available and he helped us find the perfect fit for our palates (pilsner for me!). We sat at a four top table near the wall of books at the front where you can buy a book for a donation that benefits the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund. I can get behind that! There is a spot for a stage and a counter full of board games. Awesome. For dinner, we stuck to the American-theme menu and ordered tacos and wings. They were delicious, but the tacos were definitely my favorite. Next time I would like to try something off of their real menu, which looked wholly filing and belly-warming. Do you have a favorite brew? They take special requests and will do their best to stock it for you!

Gef6Rxh6IVyFxI7sAE_jyQ,recommended,John T.,5,2014-12-20T05:04:53Z,"One of the best brewpubs I have been to in the world. Whatever else we may want to say about the English, they understand the science of crafting a good pub, or at least they used to. Wooden tables and floors with a comfy interior that beckons you to sit, drink, think, and talk in a convivial mode. The twisted hop has all of this as well as great food and beer. 

They brew their own beer, or rather Jim brews it, and they specialize in English style ""real ales"" although they have other varieties of beer and wine as well. Real ales are ales that are cask conditioned, that is, they continue to ferment in the cask. They are also dispensed with a hand pump instead of a C02 tap. This makes them delicate and amazingly flavourful in a way that typical lagers and ""bright"" ales are not. The beers at the Twisted Hop are great and you will want to give yourself some time there since you will want to try them all, maybe more than once. 

The food, despite The Twisted Hop's English DNA, is really good as well. They have Scotch eggs (ask, or maybe don't ask, what is in them), excellent chips and fish, and everything else looked good too.

We ordered the rainmaker and missionary's downfall at our server's recommendation and both drinks were some of the best cocktails I've ever had. Later on, my husband got an Inca Haze. Also an excellent drink!
Moving on to food, we asked out server for recommendations and followed his direction and he did not steer us wrong. The chargrilled jalapeno sausage was flavorful, delicious and had great dipping sauces. I wish it was a bit more jalapeno-y, but I know spicy food scares people here... We moved on to the Pork Belly and Broccolini. Wow. The pork belly had a perfectly crispy layer of skin on top, the inside was tender and not overly fatty (due to the rotisserie cooking process maybe) and served on black bean sauce with pineapple salsa. Fantastic! And who gets excited about broccolini? Anyone who eats the broccolini from here. Delicious! We scrapped every bit of sauce off the plate under the veggies.

To finish we got the Zesti Roasted pineapple. Wonderful taste explosion! Fruity, spicy, creamy,, everything you want in a dessert. I also appreciate how helpful our server Hamish and the other staff were. About 90% through our meal another couple was seated next to me, who I can only describe as a perfume-bomb. The smell was so overwhelming it was almost sending me into an asthma attack and I couldn't breathe.

We had a bacon cheeseburger, vegan burger and and an order of fries.  The burgers were hot and tasty.  The fries were a huge portion and well seasoned.  My only criticism is that they were a bit soggy.  They appeared double fried, but should have been left in a bit longer.

Once inside you'll find a host of other delicious eateries, much like a hipster gourmet food court. I ordered the Big Jim and it included fried chicken, bacon, avocado, and a yummy aioli (a NZ favorite which is a more delicious version of American ranch dressing). I had to remove the fried chicken because I couldn't bite into the burger due to its size, but it was fantastic! I got the fried cauliflower as a side and it was absolutely delectable. They were drizzled with maple syrup which was a salty/sweet combination that made my taste buds flutter with excitement. The guy at the counter was super cool, and gave my husband a discount for having a rad beard. Also, something I thought was extra special was that anything on the menu can be made vegan! 

Keep in mind that seating is a fight for your life ordeal, so be aggressive and send your friends to find a spot while you're in line to order, otherwise you'll be walking around forever trying to find a spot to sit.

Bacon Bros Burgers are located INSIDE 'The Little High Eatery' which has multiple fine eating establishments.

The whole eatery is more like OFF an alley off High Street and is easily obscured by some taller buildings.  Doesn't matter, FIND IT, it's worth it.

'The Little High Eatery' has about a dozen really cool, bohemian, artesian places.  Always better to support local than chains, go get out of Bubba Gump or the Olive Garden, and go to Bacon Bros.  Seriously kickin' burger, cooked perfectly, all the ingredients were fresh, the brioche bun soft but slightly chewy at the same time, and some nice slab bacon on top.  Very reasonably priced.

Believe me, she didn't steer us wrong.  It was by far, the best meal we hAd in all of New Zealand. The desserts were out of this world. But what made this place so fantastic was the staff, especially the owners. I noticed a previous comment about the decor...like I said, Jum and Jules are new owners and have great plans for the place. In the next few months they are updating the decor, fixing up the outdoor patio and adding the Crazy Horse Bar upstairs. Give the place a chance, I promise you will love it.  If you are one of those that tried it under the old owner, give Jum and Jules a chance to win you over.",14,"Dallas, TX",6,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-Bx0-L9OBDnSvD9Ae7Gw4A

I was disappointed though to see that the wine list is limited and not high quality. The decor and the dining room is very dated and could use some updating, but that has no bearing on the food quality. I had the spring rolls, which were fantastic and fried to perfection. The sweet and sour sauce was no slouch either. I had the Pad Thai for dinner and it is a huge portion! I could not finish the whole plate, but Lord knows I tried. The Pad Thai tastes pretty authentic and has good flavor. i was missing a little ""green"" though, and would have like some spring onions or something garnished on top.

They poured a nice drink and remained attentive and friendly throughout our meal without being intrusive. Go for the salt and pepper squid, excellently fried and crispy.  Followed that with the mussels, but asked the chef to please do a simple steamed which he did, no problem. I did the garden salad, amazingly fresh, lightly dressed and my partner did the baked market fish - on this evening monkfish - and prawns. Superbly done.

Cook'n with Gas - traditional New Zealand dishes done right. The keystone to the menu is lamb shanks with a mint jelly that will make a impression in the memory. The wine menu and pairings highlight what New Zealand has to offer to the wine world. 

Astro Bar - good for drinks beforehand, after dinner, or a meal if you're not looking for the Cook'n with Gas full experience. As the signs in the bar say, ""May the sauce be with you."" Don't miss out on the Atomic fries and sauce.

Our table was nearer the back of the restaurant and had a lot of space around it so we didn't feel crammed in and were able to be a little bit noisy. The food was fantastic, all the meat was perfectly cooked and delicious. I had the mussels as a starter and it was a very generous helping and the flavours were spot on. Next I had the mixed grill and wouldn't hesitate to order it again. Chocolate brownie for dessert was rich and decadent and a perfect finish. I tried most of the other dishes on the menu that other people had ordered and couldn't fault them.

What made dining at cook'n' with gas really special was the service. I think it takes a lot to make an impact as a server and NZ has a lot of good but not great service. Our waiter had extensive knowledge of wine and kept us entertained during the evening. Every wine choice he made was superb - it went with our meals and with our individual taste preferences.

I got great advice on trying the best oysters I have had the fortune of trying in all my visits to NZ and it was unusually matched with a dark hoppy ale that was supposing terrific! I asked for some tabasco and got that plus Lemon and Cracked pepper too.

Next came my lamb cutlets which were beautifully prepared and was promised a match unique wine; unfortunately the later never arrived, and since by now the restaurant had started to fill I was unable to flag down anyone to point out this fact till long after the meal was done.

Pressing on I tried the chocolate dessert that despite my fears it would be too sweet I was assured that it was the most elegant to try and it delivered as good as I was promised.

Unfortunately again when it came to getting the bill I had to wait 10 minutes to get someone's attention and again for them to return with my receipts so that I could leave.

This was what we ordered: 
Kikorangi Blue Cheese Plate
Salmon Ceviche
Braised Lamb Pappardelle 
Tropical Coconut Freeze

All the dishes lack in flavor, especially the Pappardelle. Watered down sauce, with no flavors, and the pasta was not good. The lamb was so tough and it shouldn't be because it was braised.  As for the ceviche, they give you a lot but its does not look like the normal ceviche you would get anywhere else, just gross.

We only ordered deserts here but saw someone had proper brunch that looks like they also gave generous proportions. 

I ordered the Chef Trio because I'm a libra that just can't decide on anything . ($21.50) 

Chocolate cake ( rich and moist with slightly melted vanilla ic cream) Cheesecake was super delicious and creme burleeeeeee ( texture was thick and creamy but not too sweet) yummmm!!  10/10

Dad had the Strawberry Pillow - this one was suggested by the waitress stated was the most popular but we all agree this one was the least favorite one from all of us. Its just angel cake splash with some fresh berries (which we appreciated and lots of whipped cream and sauce) Angel cake was decent . 6/10 

Poached Pear and Ginger Pudding - it was also good but nothing wowing! 7.5/10  


Well this also depends on what you like but seems like the locals here usually go for the cheesecake and chocolate cakes. Menu is massive , you can definitely find something you like !

It is the perfect spot for all occasions: anniversary, Sunday brunch, casual afternoon catch-up with a friend, drinks and especially dessert! The second story seems to attract a little bit of a nicer-dressed crowd while the lower level seems to be for those who just rolled out of bed or came from a workout. I wouldn't come here in anything less than a nice pair of jeans, at least. Strawberry Fare prides itself on serving local, fresh and organic food whenever possible, so you won't find fresher food anywhere else.

For breakfast I have tried the french toast (which I think is their best breakfast item), the BET (which just seemed plain, though the flavors are nice), the blueberry pancakes which are delicious and looks like the batter is poured over a scoop of large blueberries on the skillet. The Corn and Capsicum Fritters and Salmon Deluxe were huge favorites with my friends.

For lunch I enjoyed the bruschetta and the summer chicken salad. The bruschetta is fresh and the summer salad is refreshing but also has large pieces of asparagus.

For dessert I absolutely recommend the Sunken Chocolate Cake. It is gluten free and vegan, but you would never know. It is also beautifully decorated with thin, frozen honey drizzle. The little girls I was with devoured their ice cream sundaes (but who doesn't love ice cream?) 

The cool thing about Strawberry Fare though is their baking school! You can take classes at the restaurant to learn to bake (almost) as good as their chefs. This is definietly an experience everyone must do!

The decor is spot on and the music sends you straight to Cozumel. We put our name down for a table for 2 (1 hour wait) and headed to the bar area for drinks and snacks. Reservations are only accepted for groups 6 or more, so be prepared to wait for dinner reservations. 

In the bar area, the whole menu is provided for the bar area though only snacks and tacos are available for purchase. Upon seeing that, we canceled our table, ate tacos and salsa and had a caraf of margs. The guac and salsa was solid, but our chips were stale. :-/ Their tacos however, are DELICIOUS! Small portion size but healthy and filling. Definitely reminds me of Southern California's take on Mexican. Order the lamb if it's on special and don't miss out on the chicken! The prices are also extremely affordable which is great. My gripe with the menu is that it is extremely limited. Where are the enchilladas? One third of the page is food, one third advertising and one third drinks. I'd like to see more dinner options available. 

The staff still seems a little overwhelmed (give the people some credit, it's brand new!) but our drink order was forgotten as they have a confusing system of who handles the drink orders. Keeping drink orders to the respective seating area (bar v dining area) will stop that in the future. Also, to pay our tab we had to go to two different people (the front of the house and then back to the bar to get our card). There are still some inefficiencies to work out here.

We ordered a non-virgin rosewater margarita.  It came virginal.  When we mentioned it to the waiter, he smelled the carafe and told us it indeed contained tequila.  We complained again when the bill came.  The manager came to talk with us, asking us  if we knew how to make a margarita, telling us that Mexico's margaritas are designed to not have a tequila taste and questioning our experience of what a good margarita tastes like.  After I asked him if he was making us wrong he backed off and took the cost of the margaritas off the bill.  The manager would have been ahead had he just asked us what we needed to make us happy - eliminating the difference between the virgin and non-virgin option would have done it...but his arguing with us has just made us more unhappy.

We've been to Mexico in Wellington and Christchurch.  The food is creative and tasty and we particularly appreciate their attention to providing gluten free options but we'll never order margaritas here.

We dropped in on a Wednesday evening (around 8:15pm) and the place was packed. A mix of customers which is a good sign. FYI: it's BYO (for wine only). 

The menu is humongous; appetizers, salad, soup, rice noodle soup, rice vermicelli, fried egg noodle, fried rice noodle, steamed rice, fried rice, meat dishes (chicken/beef/pork/squid/fish/prawn), tofu, vegetable, egg omelet, chef special menu, roast duck and desserts. They even have a couple set menu options. So many things. Only thing I ever look it as the pho/speciality soups!

- Pho dac biet (#23) ($16.00 NZD) - special beef rice noodle soup. Comes with the standard bean sprouts and basil (super fresh!). Broth is flavourful but on the sweeter side (Southern Vietnam influence). A bit too sweet for my liking. Meat was generous and a good variety; beef tendon, beef flank, pork balls, tendon and oxtail. Oxtail was bomb. 
- Bun rieu cau ($13.00 NZD) - spicy crab rice vermicelli soup. Always a must whenever I see this on the menu! This was delicious; fantastic broth with depth and flavour. Good variety of meats including two tender meat balls, pork, a small piece of pork rib and crab. There was also a few tomatoes, tofu puffs (silky smooth) and green onion. I ate every last bit.

I'm giving this restaurants 5 stars not only for the quality of the food for its pricepoint, but also for the effort put in by the management for opening on Christmas Day (which I think is really a truly needed public service).
We ordered the pad thai with prawns, as well as a fried rice with chicken. The pad thai tasted authentic with very fresh (and plentiful!) prawns; not spicy, but I was able to add siracha to my liking. The fried rice was good, with some vegetables thrown in as well. I personally liked the pad thai more, of the two.
The service was also very attentive. Really appreciate the staff opening shop on Christmas Day! Finally, the price was on point - the best value for our NZD on this trip so far.

We opted for the fine dining and had the 6 course meal that the chef picked, as we didn't know what to choose haha!

Gave us a few great recommendations. Then gave us time to decide. We both went with a taco and appetizer. She then came back and asked if we were thinking about any cocktails. I asked what was on draft and they only had 2. Normally Mexican restaurants don't have very many so it was cool. She told us about both and I asked to taste one and she brought both drafts for tasting. It was very thoughtful cause I actually went with the one I didn't ask for. Once we got our food we started eating. And I'm telling you, the grilled chicken taco with mashed Avocado and pickled mango is one of the best tacos I've ever had. And I've had a lot of tacos.

Also the cocktail list was very good. I got two different drinks and they were both very good.

He seemed as if it was no problem and told her we could use table 14 until 645. She then relayed that to us and asked if we would like her to go over the menu. We said sure and she basically read the whole thing. I think she was just a bit awkward, other staff seemed to interact with customers in a typical way. Not a big deal, just tainted our meal. My dad tried to mention it to the manager while paying but he was distracted and didn't hear.",21,"Stillwater, OK",0,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pkht5wR79RPwivsU3Y5xww

The tacos have soft shells, but have fruit in them (chicken & mango, pork & pineapple) which adds a really nice touch. The meat is juicy and delicious. 

I also tried the corn chips with salsa. The chips were plain with some salt on them, which lets you taste the nice corn flavour without any distraction like you would get with Doritos (not that I don't like Doritos). The salsa seemed like authentic pico de gallo, a fresh chunky salsa with citrus and coriander. I don't normally like fresh tomato or coriander, but I could eat this stuff for days.

I also got a beef quesadilla, which was nice and cheesy. Not sure how else to describe it, but it was good.

As for prices, you get pretty good value for money. The tacos are small, but I think they were around $7, which is not bad considering you would pay at least $5 at a food truck for something nowhere near as good. I can't remember how much everything else was, but if you get a couple of tacos and couple of other things to share, then you get a good meal for just over $20.",26,"Canterbury, New Zealand",1,1,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=lNFbYwIAcY5wZ55qlXYzKA

There are two seating areas: the bar (first come first serve) and the dining area. The dining area is mostly tall top tables with some lower tables around the edges. I recommend the dining room as the service is much more attentive and efficient. Be sure to ask for sombreros to wear with dinner (no charge) or mustaches to take home ($2). 

The dining menu is more of a shared plate style atmosphere. For 5 people we ordered double tortillas (2/pp), chicken, beef cheek, side coleslaw and seasonal veggies and were satisfied (granted we all had had snacks before we came). We also ordered 2 margaritas (the ginger: FANTASTIC and the Locos y Explosivo: delicious but VERY caliente!). Definitely an interesting dining experience as the theme seems to focus on Dios de las Muertas (Day of the Dead) and their food is very traditional Mexican. They also serve tacos, guacamole and salsas and other options if you're not comfortable with the shared plates concept.

Just be careful as they do have dining windows and you may be evicted from your seat before  you are ready as they will have the table booked for someone else. I don't mind this, as long as you are warned when you make your reservation. In my most recent experience (staff xmas party) we were made to give up our seats before dessert, while people were still contemplating ordering more main dishes, which left a sour taste in everyones mouth. 

The food is pretty good but does come in small sizes. You will often need at least two dishes to actually start to feel full. The guac is ok, and I really like the crispy potato skins. The larger dishes are all pretty good with strong flavours. I always try and get a taco (favourite so far is the pulled pork), and a larger dish such as the ceviche or the chicken/chorizo sticks. The braised beef and pork hock are pretty good as well. And of course, some fried chicken for the table. No dish really stands out as a absolute must have, and none are particularly bad either.

Mexicanos is noisy, and dark. The atmosphere is very cool but its not a place for quiet conversations.

We went to Mexicanos at about 9:30pm on a Saturday and struggled to get a table. Initially we sat outside but were soon told that they stopped serving alcohol outside at 10pm. Inside we went.

The food reminds me a bit of the Mexico chain but perhaps a bit more 'traditional.' We had the usual guac followed by an array of soft shell tacos ($8). Unlike Mexico , the filling were generous and the meat well-cooked. They could of done with more fresh herbs but that was only a slight niggle.

We've also dined here for brunch, lunch and dinner several times! If you're with a group, there's a great private dining area off the side - so quiet, you'd think you're at home. The menu is great, and as the name suggests, there are a large number of stone plate dishes that come out sizzling hot!

One of our favourites is the sharing platter. Great value for 2 people, and less than two mains. We struggle to eat it all. Pretty much an entree, main and dessert all on one board!

Someone answered the phone, I asked my question and he answered me in a heavily thick Afghan accent yes we are open and hung up.   I found that funny.   
My hotel check in clerk recommended this restaurant to me and said it was delicious.   
I got to the restaurant and it was jammed packed.   I was looking at the menu on the wall and someone waiting for carry out said to me ""you have to ask the cook what he has tonight"".    The menu is never updated.  There is only the cook and a cashier/assistant working in the restaurant.  So I approached the cook who was working furiously in an open kitchen in the same area as the dine in tables, carry out waiting area and cashier.   
There were about 20 people sitting at communal tables and when a dish was ready for the seated guests the cook would just hand the dish to the nearest customer waiting for carry out or to pay at the cash register and asked them to take to ""that table"".
He was working furiously and had not yet noticed me standing in front of him.  He was doing about six carry out containers at once with rice, one chicken kebab and one ground meat kebab with a side of salad.    He looked up and started giving people their carry out orders and each was 20 NZ dollars or about 14.50 US (per person).  All the time smiling and greeting everyone with hellos and goodbyes unless you were Muslim then it was assalamualaikum (peace be unto you).  
I told him I will have that same dish and he assembled it on the spot and added another container and said this is free.  I was hoping that was Afghan bread.   I paid my 20 dollars and left.  
The food was some of the best Afghan food I have ever had.   I lived in Afghanistan for awhile and have eaten Afghan food in many other countries. 
The ground meat kebab was lamb, it was moist and had all the right spices, superb!  The chicken kebab was marinated in a red yogurt spice which resembled red Tika but tasted better.    The rice was divine and the extra container was a butter style curry chicken with two chicken legs that was spicy hot.    It was the best butter chicken I have ever had.   I had no room for the salad so it went uneaten.  If I go back to NZ I will make a side trip just to eat here.

The drinks menu is extensive with us two oldies just having beers, but our son had a Roger Rabbit? cocktail which he really enjoyed with his sweet tooth. But the range is extensive and only limited by your imagination and liver.
The food is based on southern USA and can be summed up as delicious sticky goodness. We shared some pretzel bread with a chilli molasses butter, which sounds interesting, but tastes divine and some Cajun fries which cater for the more timid Kiwi palate. Missy had chicken sliders which literally disappeared within minutes as we shared some Bourbon and coke ribs, gooey and tasty. We also tried the chicken tenders with a maple and black pepper sauce as well as the sirloin with loaded tater tots, both of which were delicious.

There is plenty of seating inside from tall top tables to more intimate seating and group tables. There are plenty of TVs to catch a game or catch the clues for quiz night. 

The menu is limited but good quality. The chicken sandwich is hearty and topped with an aioli dressing and bacon. The side of chips are thick-cut and soft on the inside. You can order aioli or ketchup on the side. I have seen a fish and potatoes ordered, the fish are smothered in a sauce and, as a non-pescatarian, I find it sloppy and unappetizing. The onion rings as an entree would be a good choice as they are crispy on the outside and slimy onion on the inside..just the way any good onion rings should be. I recently tried the three ice cream and warm chocolate chip cookie which was heavenly. The cookie is thick and crumbly and the ice creams were stellar (double chocolate, vanilla with cherry and mint chocolate chip).

1) Their Signature Giant Fried Chicken Cutlet - as per description it was not that Giant. It looked rather beaten, flat & dry instead of a succulent piece of chicken. The seasoning 
though was alright. 

2) Braised Minced Pork Rice (small size $6.50) - rather confusing as in this dish usually minced pork is used but in it's description it says finely chopped pork belly. The most disappointing of the lot! In the bowl there was approx. 3/4 cup of steamed rice, literally 1 tablespoonful of the finely chopped braised pork belly, half a braised egg & *note instead of using pickled mustard greens ...it was 2 slices of Japanese pickled daikon. 

3) Taiwanese Style Beef Noodle Soup - Surely they can't go wrong with a signature noodle dish which is eaten all over Taiwan! But they did! Egg noodles were used here instead of hand made pulled noodles which has more of a mouth feel. The braised beef was ok. Soup base fell very flat! It tasted like a soup mix out of a packet. Unusually & oddly sweet, not the kind of sweetness that is extracted out of a stock made from scratch. Small plus point, they did have pickled mustard greens in this dish.

4) Mango Shaved Ice with Vanilla Ice cream - Don't know why I bothered haha! Didn't want to make another pit stop for dessert & hey how bad can they mess this one up eh? Unfortunately it was not a sweet ending but a soupy one. The shaved ice was coarse & both ice and ice cream had half melted when it was served. Mango bits were the only good thing in this dessert. 

Four dishes & $40 later, totally not impressed ): I felt I was never going to find any good small eats but I did!!! A wee gem in a tiny food court right next to the Countdown Supermarket on the corner of Moorhouse Ave & Madras Street. There are just four stalls there but the one that was absolutely buzzing was Hang Seng Food Bar. I ordered the hot & spicy (& sour) noodle soup with braised beef, tripe, fish balls, bean sprouts & pickled mustard greens $12. A good serving, it arrived piping hot (: The flavours were balanced & one that was immediately familiar as it hit my taste buds. Not joking...it was almost tears at first bite!!! They delivered! SO GOOD!!! As I sat there observing, their fried rice & fried noodles were very popular too. For just a small stall they had an extensive menu (with pictures) & I can't wait to go back to try more!

The place- well decorated, low key, good amount of seats.

The food- good selection of all the Taiwanese food that you can crave for!!! We ordered the popcorn chicken. Was a bit disappointed. The meat was on the tougher side and not well marinated. And lacks the familiar salty pepper power that you find in Taiwan popcorn chicken. 
The bubble tea was a bit too well done. It's a tapioca was a bit too soft.

Service- good, friendly.

The coleslaw was also a large portion, and was crunchy with a number of julienned vegetables covered with a slightly creamy dressing with a pleasant vinegar taste. The mushroom sauce probably had a lot of calories, but the meal tasted great, and I mostly had chicken and veggies.

After a month of traveling and not always having the best food, I was definitely craving some Asian comfort food.  When I saw dumpling bar, it was like my prayers have been answered!  

We ordered so much food!  Pork 'n' Garlic Chive Dumplings, Pork 'n' Ginger and Spring Onion Dumplings, Pork Belly Bao Bun, Beijing Duck Bao Bun, Pork & Prawn Shumai, Steamed Asian Greens, and PSDB Signature Xiaolongbao.  I was soooooooo excited for our food.  

But then, a few items came out, we stuffed our faces, and then the food just stopped.  It took a very long while for the rest of our food to come out.  Turns out they forgot about the rest of our orders.  I was pretty frustrated (but still patient) at the time, and the server was very apologetic about the wait.  They even gave us a cucumber salad for free.  When I finally got the check, they took off about ¾ of our bill - most of the dumplings and even our drinks.  

So, in the end, we left as happy campers with full bellies.  Would I come back?  Absolutely!  The food was phenomenal.",4,"San Diego, CA",2,2,1,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=h8pthOnqCxV94D8-JkZXCQ

Do7ayiKlaaYwppPZ3CRYWw,recommended,Esther S.,3,2016-01-22T01:03:57Z,"We are Asian Americans who were on the last leg of our honeymoon when we came upon this place.  Let's just say I was longing for some Asian food after feeling like I smelled like a New Zealand lamb from eating so much of it.  Dumplings sounded like an amazing idea.  I knew I wasn't supposed to expect much..

First thing I noticed. 
We were the only Asians in the place when we walked in.  Hm.. hope that doesn't mean anything..

Second thing,
The place is kind of dark, like they are trying to make eating Chinese dumplings a cool, hip, bad-boy, thing to do.  Strange, but okay.  I didn't like the weird eerie dark background music with random Chinese going on.  Eerie, very eerie.

Now what about the food?
Food was good.  The dumplings (fried) were nice and crispy, though as another reviewer said, kind of an interesting style I hadn't had before.  The steamed dumplings were not bad as well.
The xiao long bao was good, but the skin was not as thin as I like (It's not DIN TAI FUNG, k guys?).  
They ran out of duck :( so we also got the pork belly ""burger"" ... that was good, crispy pork deliciousness, and kind of funny.  It's basically bigger than your average pork belly open faced bun (IDK how to say it in English), so they call it a burger!

Also, the service, was, really, not there.  
I would have given them higher stars if they had been a little, LITTLE more attentive.  We were waiting for so long sitting at the table with our menu that I started to wonder if we were supposed to go to the counter to order??  Genuinely!  We weren't.. ?  We also were given no napkins to start with.  We asked for a refill on water and it came the first time, but the second time, it didn't come.  

--Bottom line, it was good for a dumpling craving coming from California, but it was more expensive than what we were used to and we didn't like the bar feel.--",6,"Clovis, CA",2,1,1,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1AmDkEN8U7FiRe7xZeQL1w
Do7ayiKlaaYwppPZ3CRYWw,recommended,Asuka N.,3,2015-12-21T21:12:36Z,"On our way out of Christchurch, we stopped at Pot Sticker to grab a quick bite. I have to say that their website is quite clear about their enthusiasm about dumplings, and the storefront - with a lot of manga art around the front - is similarly reflective of the affinity for Asian culture.   Placing our order was relatively quick, and after a ~7-10 minute wait, we sat down at the bar surrounding the restaurant, we started chowing down. The one upshot here is that the meat filling, particularly the pork, is much higher-quality stuff than your usual generic pork meat that gets stuffed in dumplings. The flavor of the pork is very good, and I really liked the flavor of the winter warmer dumplings. Unfortunately, the technique was not up to snuff, detracting away from the overall experience. The wrapper on the steamed dumpling was a bit rubbery, making each bite a tad strange. The fried dumpling was even more puzzling; it appears that all that is done is taking a steamed dumpling and having it sit in a skillet covered with a thin film of frying oil. All this served to do was give the outer edges a crisp, but since they were steamed, it made them extremely dry.

In short - while the filling is pretty top-notch, the wrapper and cooking technique of the dumpling fell a bit short of what I would expect in my favorite dumplings. If they could perfect that, along with doing a true fried dumpling (e.g. don't steam them, then attempt to fry them - just throw the whole thing on the skillet and give it a good oily crisp on the bottom) - this would definitely get a marked-up rating from me.",7,"New York, NY",2,1,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CJmtS1Uk1KSsY2MWol_E7g
Do7ayiKlaaYwppPZ3CRYWw,recommended,Druinie P.,5,2015-07-18T02:44:38Z,"This is a tiny corner-store in the Colombo mall that looks like it belongs in a Japanese manga! 

Order a dozen steamed or fried dumplings, choose your filling and dipping sauce, then sit back and wait for the magic to unfold!  

Watch the little dumpling masters expertly cup each pot-sticker wrapper in their palm, slap a bit of filling, then lace it with sesame oil and the hot, soupy juice that will squirt out when you bite into it! A thumb here and there, and before you can say 'kung fu', the edges are sealed and neatly crimp frilled! 

Slosh goes the oil, in goes the pot-stickers until they start to brown, then comes the scoop of hot water and down goes the bamboo lid! Ask for steamed dumplings and watch the pot-stickers get chucked into boiling water and gently poked around until they start to float! 

Pick them up with your chopsticks, dunk them in the sauce and stick them in your gob for the best dumpling experience - this side of China!

Don't expect to find any food here but dumplings but thats ok because they are exceptional. 
There are generally about 4-5 different flavours, and they do vege tuesday. The beef and beetroot is surprisingly spectacular (I had my doubts) and my personal favourite is the classic pork and coriander. Your options are 6/12/18 steamed or fried. Be prepared to wait if you want fried as its always busy. Steamed is faster. I go for the ""dozen matter"" which offers a selection of all the flavours, and yes you can get 6 of the dozen matter if you are just after a snack. These dumplings are exploding with flavour, packed full of filling, and perfectly cooked.

I have only been during the lunch hour and the line is always at least 5 or 6 people long. They offer 5 flavors (4 are always the same, one changes) and you can order them by the 1/2 or dozen. I prefer to order the ""Dozen Matter"" where you can get whichever dumplings you want. My favorite flavors are Garlic Pork and Chive (staple) the Vegetarian option (staple) or Beefroot (speciality: beef + beetroot). They also have chicken dumplings, too. There are 3 sauces to choose from (or get all three) chili, vinegar, soy. You can ask for them to be extra hot if you'd like (as someone who can't stand heat, the chili does have a bite). 

There is seating in the mall, both at a large communal table and on stools against the dumpling joint. I love sitting at the stools because you can watch the dumplings being made, which provides entertainment while you wait (at least 10 minutes from order time).

Street parking is definitely hard to find, and you will need to find a spot longer than 30 minutes. This is not a quick ""in and out"" option as the dumplings are cooked to order.

It ranks up as one of my top brunch spots in Christchurch and one not to be missed by locals and visitors alike. There will absolutely be a wait if you don't have a booking (and maybe even so if you do have a booking and tables haven't turned over, the space is small and the wait is worth it). If you try to walk in (as we did) the staff will usher you to a waiting room in the store next door and ask for your drink order. Having the coffee while we waited helped wake us up and keep us cheery. About 30 minutes later we were seated at a small wooden table with a chair on one side and wooden bench seat on the other. My husband ordered the Ham Hock Waffles and I ordered the Avocado Smash (not listed on their online menu). 

The Ham Hock Waffle was a large waffle smothered in ham hock bits and a tomato relish salad complete with melted cheese covering the waffle, chunks of soft cheese, tomatoes, rocket and sprouts. The presentation is fabulous, but the flavor is even better. 

The Avocado Smash was simply a piece of multi-grain toast simply smothered in smashed avacado and topped with a poached egg, served with polenta fries and chopped cherry tomatoes on the side. Holy Yum. I didn't even want to share with hubby, but since he let me try the waffle, I had to return the favor. VERY reluctantly. 

We also split a cinnamon bun, which disappeared from our plates before I could snap a photo. It was warm, gooey and fantastic.

Fear Not - this place is not one that requires reservations a month in advance. Show up and be ready for your taste buds to go on an adventure way more exciting than Frodo's Trip to Mordor!

*IF YOU DONT LIKE SPICY FOODS - READ THE MENU CAREFULLY* This place packs the heat!!

Foe those crazy souls still down to test your mouths limits, you've come to the right place.

As soon as you walk in, you'll smell the charcoal burning that's smoking the meats right in front of you. This place makes your dish fresh to order - no hidden microwaves in the back.

Every bite I had was better than the last.

Tandodi Chicken Wings were smokey, salty, and spicy. Use the lemon wedge provided to give that extra acidity and really take this dish over the edge.

Kadai Chicken was thick, complex, tender, and spicy!  It was not as sauce-heavy as a butter chicken, but there was enough sauce to be great over rice. We also ordered the Garlic Naan and it was a perfect addition. 

Green Apple Pickle - I wasn't sure about this at first, but I'm so glad we got this side dish. I enjoy spicy food, but I'm no wildfire warrior that can swallow spice without grimace. These Apple bits were the perfect palate cleanser and really reset my mouth before each dish. Still crunchy, and slightly tart, the apples were refreshing and crisp - a welcome reprieve for a mouth slowly catching on fire.

I must ding them for one small thing, though, the ""naan chips"" were nearly indistinguishable from the crispy noodles served in Chinese restaurants in the States with egg drop soup.  Even with this, I can't deduct any stars, the rest of the meal was just too good.

The same sentiments are from customers
-Vijay Shekhar
- Husahnpreet Kaur 
The behavior of the owner exactly mimics the name of the restaurant ""mumbaiwala"" 
Which basically depicts street person with no customer centricity.Very arrogant and rude . No manners on how to deal with customers.
The owner has Absolutely no idea about being customer focus
This person Needs to stay in Mumbai rather than in a place like Christchurch 
I had very good impression about people in NZ during my Trip so far but this owner really puts a black spot on my total impression
Having said that my 99% experience in NZ was just fantastic.
I am so so so glad that we left the restaurant without eating their and then were suggested one of the best Indian restaurants in Christchurch called Coriander.
Thanks for the owners arrogance and his Mumbai tone , 
I will definitely not be recommending mumbaiwala to anybody in USA and being in field of public relations can at-least help over few thousand people to stay away from this restaurant and arrogant / rude behavior of the owner.

We went for the trust the chef option because, well that was the only option I could choose when booking which has a penalty of $50 if you don't turn up. This have the place an air of exclusivity but it annoyed me. Not a good start but hey.
We also noticed people were ordering what they liked, so not sure if there was a limit on order your own or not. Anyway, ordered some wine by the glass from a snotty waiter. A young guy who clearly needs to eat some humble pie. 
The other waiter thankfully was the opposite and real nice.
So the food was below par, the chicken we got was cooked well, moat and tasty. But the rest of the 5 courses other than the dessert were how can I say, like stuff they wanted to get rid of.
I'm short, for what you pay and what you get, which includes the service, the food, the experience, it's not worth the money.

Then, when we entered the restaurant, we were directed to these high barstools that overlook the kitchen area. It took until we started awkwardly draping our coats on the barstools for them to offer to take our coats (we also witnessed the hostess take the coats for others before us, so I'm not sure why it was so awkward for us). We did the 'Trust the chef"" option. The food was good, but not amazing.

We had 7pm reservations and were promptly seated at the kitchen bar with a view of all the delicious dishes being prepared. The restaurant features a sharable menu in which you can either order dishes separately or you can ""Trust Us"".  We had to go with the ""Trust Us"" menu, which featured six different dishes. We also added the wine pairing featuring local New Zealand wines that went perfectly with each dish. The first dish was the Tua Tua Clam Crudo, Cucumber & Gin. These tender and fresh clams were topped with citrusy crispy cucumbers. This was a light but flavorful dish and a nice way to start dinner. Next came my favorite dish of the night: Duck Trumpets & Blackberry Jam. Rich and creamy duck pate with a hint of sweet jam sat in a crispy waffle cone and was topped with crunchy nuts. This was an addictive balance of flavors and textures. I was on the verge of ordering another pair but the next dish distracted me: Charred Broccoli Root, Smoked Ricotta & Almonds. Inati turned the part of the broccoli that you threw away as a kid into something amazing! The broccoli stalk was super tender with a hint of smokiness and paired with creamy ricotta and crunchy almonds. Next was the Parsnip, Apple & Candied Walnut. I don't think I've ever had a parsnip before but I quickly became a fan! The vegetable was savory with a creamy topping (similar to mashed potatoes), sweet apples, and crisp walnuts. Aged Duck & Scratching was next. A crisp juicy lightly fatty skin surrounded mouthwatering, tender and lightly salty duck meat. An eggroll with even more tender duck meat added more deliciousness. Before our last dish (dessert), I wanted to order one more savory item that wasn't included in the ""Trust Us"" offering: Venison Bresaola, Seaweed & Pistachio. The venison was tender and gamey with a sweet jam and topped with powdered pistachios. Finally we had the Honey, Brown Butter & Sage for dessert. Airy and lightly sweet and salty custard was topped with creamy sweet sage ice cream and crunchy nuts.

I may as well get a membership to the gym, because I will be in the building, at Inati frequent enough to want to burn that guilt off at said gym. I could go to the gym, then go to Inati... Or just skip the gym all together.

This place is incredible. World class fare, new style, eclectic takes on classic and modern cuisines. Butcher's ""scrapes"" honoring the whole beast. Using familiar, natural and curious (in a good way!) flavors, all rolled together and discovered in a single plate. With local organic ingredients.

Small plates concept, with a couple larger plates available - I dined alone, so I opted to stick with the smaller plates (be warned larger plates. Your time will come to be inside me, too...)

Tonight was my first time dining at Inati, and the food was very possibly the best I've had in all my years visiting Christchurch (about 9 years now). Possibly the best meal I've had in the whole of New Zealand.

Service was professional, courteous and friendly (albeit the server was a little slow - Which is fine, as I recognized that there seemed to only be 2 front of the house staff, working the room. Maybe three? There was a guy who greeted me, but I couldn't tell his actual position. Sommelier/Host maybe?) But, I was fortunate enough to sit in front of whom I presume was the Chef - Who helped with front of the house duties for his single diner guest. 

2 notes of disappointment that I experienced:
The drink selections seemed somewhat limited with only beer and wine options. I personally prefer a small, limited cocktail program as an apertif. As well as coffee and/or espresso with dessert - But the restaurant is small, so it's forgivable that they may not have the room for a bar/hot drinks area.

The server was very friendly, accommodating and actually from Burma/Myanmar.  Food was very tasty with authentic flavors, but can be adjusted for Western palates (primarily by dialing down the heat). If you have spicy food lovers, be sure to ask for the chilies on the side...they pack a lot of heat!  We enjoyed the Le Pet Thoke salad, Seit Da Kin (lamb skewers) and Jetda Ono Hin curry.  Everything was delicious and goes well with their selection of beers.  Only thing that I would change is perhaps having a little more tea leaves in the Le Pet Thoke.  Overall a lovely dinner and nice change of pace from the other Asian (mostly Japanese, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese) restaurants in town.",1,"Irvine, CA",0,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=z8oWtLQVMHRR64wecCW8Fw

It's merged with The Bodhi Tree so don't confuse the two; it's now under one roof. Mama Hooch is located right next door to them.

We dropped in for an early Monday dinner (around 5:45pm). The inside is gorgeous with two floors and a very clean, modern look. Interesting that most of the clientele was Caucasian. 

The menu is short and sweet; nibbly bits, soups, vegetable/salad, meat, seafood and desserts. The drink menu is standard but at least the bottles are reasonable. 

- Lepet thoke ($14.50 NZD) - tea leaf salad is a Burmese speciality. Pickled tea leaves mixed with lentils, nuts, sesame seeds and chili. Barely any heat nor much tea leaf flavour but still a tasty dish. Also, way too pricey for such a small appetizer. 
- 2x steamed rice ($3.00 NZD/person) - we weren't sure but turns out you can get free refills on rice. Sweet because it's steep enough for plain white rice. 
- Nga kin ($17.50 NZD) - a boneless fillet of fresh fish (grouper) baked in the oven. When this dish got dropped off, we did a double take. Smallest piece of fish I've seen on a plate. Fish was nicely cooked but plain. Luckily, the side sauce was BOMB; could have drank that on its own. It was sweet, spicy and tangy (a mix of soy sauce, fish sauce, vinegar, cilantro, chives and hot pepper).
- Seit da nut ($16.50 NZD) - lamb curry cooked with lemongrass, ginger and curry leaves. You get three pieces; again, small portion but the lamb was tender and delicious. Wish that you'd get some vegetables with this dish.

Good flavours but know coming in that portions are small. 3.5 stars.",4,"Vancouver, Canada",0,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg

Suggest getting the standard sauces, which include a garlic yoghurt tatziki and a Greek tomato based sauce. Together with a juicy meat of your choice (chicken, lamb, beef, or mixed) and salad it's a very tasty lunch indeed.

It's a smallish place but still has about 8 - 10 tables. Dark interior. My favorite part of the decor was the trip advisor awards they had all over their restaurant walls. There were I think 4. And they only had a 4.2, so they really were proud of that low 4. And I love that they maybe thought that would be the deciding factor for someone to eat there. ""Well I'm not sure if I want anything but I'm already here in the restaurant. man... That 4.2 on trip advisor really sold me. I'll stay!""

Ok anyways.. Chicken was pretty good. A bit dry. They put sauces on top so the chicken soaks it up if you don't eat quick. But a nice addition. You can choose from like 8 flavors. Photo will be listed. I tried Sweet Chili. Just enough kick to make it taste good. They also have a chili bang bang flavor which is about as hot as you wound expect. Sampled it and I felt like I was shot in the mouth. Pun intended. $18nzd for a portion. The portion size is really big too, enough for 2 people easily.

They serve alcohol too fyi. Something about fried chicken and beer drives Koreans crazy. I dig it too.

We went during peak dinner hours on a Tuesday, so street parking was a bit tight and we ended up having to park down a side street and walk a bit, but not too much of a problem. We didn't have a reservation so we were seated at a counter and then later moved to a table. 

The highlight was definitely the tiramisu --delicious and served with a little scoop of gelato as well. The penne carbonara was also cooked well and tasty.

6xwZXfzXRALKHrVg13aN8A,recommended,Catherine A.,4,2015-03-17T21:34:24Z,"I would arguably say this is the best pizza joint in all of Christchurch. The place is always hopping come dinner time, so I definitely recommend a booking. In the summer months they have ""dining al Fresco"" in their back courtyard. Though it is tucked under umbrellas and right along a little creek, it is patio seating in a parking lot by dumpsters. Not totally my thing. However, the rest of the restaurant has plenty of seating for groups or intimate date settings as well as casual tables up front. 

The pizza is FANTASTIC. The Cantadina, Margherita, Pollo Pesto and Quattro Formaggi are among my favorites. Di Carne and Umbria are my partner's. He prefers bold flavors like black olives and meat while I am after the cheese and basil. My dad has ordered the traditional spaghetti (bolognese) and our whole family had to dig in and eat some of it. The Della Casa salad is a great salad to split to add some more greens to the meal. The waiters will gladly help you pair a great wine with your meal if you ask.

The service is efficient as they need to keep the tables turning over and if you call for takeaway, as I do frequently, the order will be ready in 20 minutes. Though the price is a bit steep for a pizza, you have to remember that you're paying for the best (and the cost of overhead in Merivale). This is a great date night spot or a great place to order takeaway for your family on a weekday night.

ef_7yuIopviUy9-elYfJpQ,recommended,James A.,5,2025-03-29T03:52:53Z,"It's an interesting name for a restaurant since 'Fisherman's Wharf' brings ideas of a water-place community where fisherman come in from the sea with the freshest products from the sea.  There might be a variety of seafood restaurants at a fisherman's wharf, but the singularity of naming a restaurant that, confused me for a bit.  But I realized it was a single restaurant, located between the cruise port of Lyttelton and its town center.  It did have a variety of seafood, and much of it was excellent.

We didn't have a reservation, but were seated right away.  There are choices of both outdoor and indoor dining, and the back outdoor patio was available (though it filled up by the time we left).  It had a great view of the port, with the ship that we came in on, prominently visible on the skyline.  A bottle of tap water was provided so we could fill our own glass...the water is very good here. 

Dozen Bluff oysters:  6 of them raw, 6 battered and fried. NZ$72
We came for the Bluff oysters, which are currently in season.  It was the first time I had them, and they were superb, unlike other oysters I've had.  They are decent in size, but the difference is the texture, meaty instead of slippery.  It's not as briny as other oysters, and didn't come with any vinegar but instead a shareable green salad.  They are big enough to deep fry, which were fine.  But the best way is to eat them raw, to appreciate the taste and texture.

Fresh NZ Green lipped mussels. NZ$25.5 - probably 8 large full shell mussels, swimming in a light creamy tomato broth.   Frozen NZ half shelf mussels are available around the world, being very meaty.  These tasted similar, but were quite a bit larger in size which added to enjoyment.  This dish would be excellent served on top of fresh pasta.

Seafood Sizzle Plate (NZ$46.5) - portrayed as their most popular dish, it combines a variety of popular shellfish, served on a sizzling plate.  All the seafood was good.

Fisherman's Seafood Chowder (NZ$30.5) - a volute (basic french white sauce, no cream but uses butter) based soup, full of quality seafood.   This was the dish I thought I wouldn't be able to help finish, but ended up being the one where I ate the most of.  It came with a very good garlic bread, great to dip in the soup.

Blue Cod Fish Fry (NZ$40) - a large beer battered filet of cod, served with good chips (fries). 

They had four beers on tap, so got a pint (NZ$14) of Montheiths Golden Lager, which was a good beer to drink with the seafood. 

Service was prompt and friendly throughout, and the food didn't take very long to come out.  Of course, the beautiful weather and nice seaside views certainly didn't hurt the vibe.  It was a really nice lunch.",2,"Long Beach, CA",3,3,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JEMdASHfeXcQF3zDka1fVw

I was lucky to get a table without a booking, even for just a party of one.  So I recommend making a booking if you plan on dining here.

I ordered the roasted cauliflower, that came with a romesco sauce, a fish taco, and one of their sangrias.  Everything was delicious!  I love roasted cauliflower and theirs definitely ticks all the boxes.  It was perfectly charred on the outside and soft on the inside.  The romesco sauce was bright flavors from the acidity of the tomato, which paired well with the smokiness of the cauliflower.

The fish taco was good too!  It wasn't greasy despite it being fried. It came with capers, which I don't actually like, but in this taco it was yummy and needed with the fish.  The sangria was comprised of rosé, mint, and strawberries.  It was light and fruity.

Service was excellent!  The staff made sure I was doing fine throughout my meal.  The atmosphere is vibrant and loud.

Chiwahwah's seems to be more of a fusion restaurant, but I don't think they advertised themselves as a traditional Mexican restaurant anyway.

Got to a table quickly but it was excruciatingly slow the rest of the night.  Server forgot drink orders and we had to remind her several times before they were brought to us.  The establishment is on the louder side when it comes to voices from nearby tables and the music playing through their sound system. Their only saving grace was the food.  It was great.  It was definitely not Mexican though.  I would categorize it more as a fusion between New Zealand and Mexican, so Kiwi-Mexican.  Although the food tasted great it is a little misleading to brand themselves as a Mexican Cantina.

I might have called it a few names myself due to its propensity to slide apart. But what would one expect from a bacon cheeseburger that adds pineapple, avocado and beetroot to its content? Aside from the cheese, every topping and condiment on that sandwich is slippery. The combination isn't one I'd experienced before, but I found it all well matched. And I was surprised to find all that content didn't overwhelm the flavor of the beef (though not by much).

I might give even greater props, though, to the fries. Remember the perfect crispness of McDonald's fries when they were at their best? Take that fry quality but apply it to a chunkier, thicker cut of potato, and that's what you'll get at BurgerFuel. Delicious. 

I enjoyed this meal after some lengthy travels, and the restaurant is positioned well for air and road travelers, being just off State Highway 1 and only a short distance from CHC.

Getting back to the sloppiness, it was only in the finishing bites of my meal that I realized the staff had provided me with a tool to help keep my burger together -- the nifty little Doofer, a pop-together burger keeper that my ignorance kept me from testing when I needed it most.

I found the restaurant difficult to find and managed to drive past it twice! In all fairness though, that may just be my own poor sense of direction. Park in the hotel right next door. 
This is a very elegant restaurant with a classic and restrained decor. Tables are beautifully laid out with white tablecloths and the chairs are comfortable but of a solid quality (my favourite type). We went on a random wednesday night so it was fairly quiet. Service was excellent - a french waiter which certainly adds to the ambience!

As for food, I was a little disappointed. Maybe my expectations were to high. I ordered the escargot (entree) and the cassoulet (main). Both were good but didn't wow me. The duck in the cassoulet was actually a little dry. My friend picked much better than me and next time I would probably order what she had. She had the foie gras for entree and the steak for main and both were absolutely excellent. Perfectly cooked, lovely well balanced flavours. 
Dessert was delicious, I can never go past a perfectly cooked chocolate fondant. 
Good wine menu, and served in nice big glasses which I like. 

Next time I would probably choose the surprise menu, the only reason I didn't this time is that I had a major craving for some cassoulet and some escargot and didn't want to take the risk that they might not be included! 

Price wise this is at the top end of the scale for Christchurch but food and ambience are of a high quality. That said $90 each for a three course meal and a glass of wine is not unreasonable.

And pretty much the entire crew are Kiwis?? No fruit isn't running this restaurant that's what they call themselves here. This place though.. It was good. Really good!

Lots of meat in our dishes to. 3 items and it was plenty for 3 of us. And they make sure to label the menu to let you know what is spicy, and extra spicy. So no surprises here!

Decor is nice and understated, didn't stand out particularly. What you are here for is the food which is amazing. 
We ordered a lot of food with the plan to place it in the middle and share it, allowing us to sample a good range. Our waitress seemed a bit shocked by how much we ordered and actually advised us to order less but we plowed ahead (in retrospect she was probably right..) Food comes out fresh as it is prepared and as such is always hot and perfectly cooked. It was all timed perfectly so that as one plate was finished, the next one was coming out. 
We started with edamame which is a classic we all enjoy. Highly recommend the deep fried takoyaki (octopus ball) which was incredible. I'd never had them before and we ordered it on the recommendation of my asian companions but would definitely get it again. The spider rolls (soft shell crab sushi) were another standout. Amazing taste and presentation. For mains the particular highlights were the K.F.C (we ordered a second plate of this), and the specials menu and sizzling dishes are well worth a look. The only dish we didn't enjoy was the eggplant gratin. 
We finished this meal extremely full and contented. Didn't look at the desert menu. 

Service is good and attentive but our waitress did forget to bring us any water during our meal. It can be expensive if you order a lot of dishes but well worth it for a special night out. I think we spent about $80 each, without alcoholic drinks included.

I went there three times in almost as many days and thought about going even more. The food is good.

All dining guests are seated facing around the master chef, we found it enjoyable and had an intimate conversation while eating even with company of strangers, we both decided to order the Amaterrace special which is NZ 49$ that included an appetizer, soup, 5 hibachi entrees and dessert.

We started off with cold bottle of sake, miso soup and has started making stir fried mix veggies, he then followed it with tiger prawns glazed with butter, Akaroa salmon with scallops, teppanyaki fried rice together with NZ premium eye fillet served with garlic mushrooms and marinated grilled chicken, we found it overwhelming but managed to finish all the dishes as they were cooked and served right before our very eyes. We then capped our dinner with a delicious ice cream with chocolate syrup.

It was late Sunday evening (close to 9 PM), and the Japanese restaurant Sakimoto was closed. My boyfriend was on the hunt for roast duck, but the nearby Thai restaurant, Sampan House Restaurant, didn't have great reviews. We set our eyes on Chong's, which was located very close to our hotel and had an expansive takeaway menu that included smoked duck, $24 for half, $46 for whole. We also got a small bowl of sour and spicy soup ($5 for small, $18 for large) and a small portion of steamed white rice ($2). The waitress quoted us 10-15 minutes, so we took a short walk around (the rather desolate) town before coming back to grab our food. The duck was pre-packaged in a vacuum-sealed bag (valid until Feb 5, 2018, so more than 2 weeks from today) and lukewarmly heated. Flavor wasn't bad, though it was too salty for my taste, so make sure you get some carbs to pair with the duck. The sour and spicy soup was indeed sour and mildly spicy, just like any ol' sweet and sour soup.

I noticed that all the wait staff was Korean so perhaps my expectations were a bit high.  We ordered the lamb BBQ (since this is something I've never had at a Korean restaurant), the soon tofu soup, and the beef wraps.

The lamb BBQ was the best thing we had, it had pretty good flavor.  Unfortunately, the soon tofu soup was a disappointment, it was spicy but watery at the same time.  Beef wraps were essentially bulgogi wrapped in rice paper.  The banchan (side dishes) were a bit lackluster.

I told the waitress to ""bring me something sweet and white,"" for a wine, and that she did. There are two sizes of wine offered (see lines on your glass), and I chose the smaller one. I was brought riesling (see photo), which was light, sweet, and had a clean finish. It was just what I wanted! 

I give 3 stars because of the spaghetti carbonara. It was quite oily, and the balance of pasta vs the mushrooms and bacon was not correct. My bowl was still 1/3 full of the other stuff even though I'd finished the pasta. Furthermore, the top layer of parmesan melted and hardened, to the point of being inedible. If you're Italian, you may want to ask for no cheese on top since this isn't done in Italy (at least where I was in Rome, Florence, etc).

I also ordered the side of salad greens. I wasn't told it came with dressing or what kind (normally don't eat dressing), so I was surprised to see a brown gravy-like substance on top. It turned out to be a balsamic vinegar based dressing, but be sure to specify if you're particular about dressing.

ambiance//*****
the restaurant's ambiance is modernly upscale without pomp or circumstance
when you step through the quilted doors, the reception area's chandelier provides a hint of the glamour that awaits!
the coolest thing is the wall decor made of burnt zip ties.....who knew something so ordinary could be elevated exponentially??

service//**
the waitstaff, and especially hostess eiko was pleasant for the most part
halfway through, i discovered an EARWIG in my water O_O EWWWW!
the waiter took my glass away without an apology...and we had to ask for new glasses
it was extremely disconcerting...and my cousin was upset enough to mention it to eiko when she was taking care of our bill....she was equally horrified and apologized quickly moving to inform her manager

the manager merely said they would write a report so the entire staff would know....uh...WHAT?
they didn't even have the decency to comp us for our drinks...HOW RUDE

food//*****
there are 3 dining options...the 12 dish pre-fixe . 5 dish middle menu . or a la carte

we decided to go with the 5 dish and ordered each of the available choices...so we really had 10 dishes and a few extras like the amuse bouche kickoff

their dishes were delightfully plated and tasted exquisitely delicate...favourites of ours include the fried oyster . smoked eggplant . cured venison
with a name like pescatore, it's a given their seafood would be delightful....but their meats were also prepared with elegance
the 8 textures of white was the only disappoint, but the milk & honey was lovely
the paper thing dessert crisps were the lovely end
~*~
how i would have liked to recommend you highly....but all i can say is check your water!!
i know for years to come, pescatore will be remembered as our weird earwig experience.....can't say you didn't make it a memorable night",2,"Los Angeles, CA",1,1,1,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TiD1JrLX-LiCdQabMwj4Fg

I definitely recommend a booking for the weekend (bookings can be made online or over the phone). Despite being located off busy Riccarton Road, Buddha Stix is tucked back in its own private lot and the massive Buddha head statue and greenery that greets you almost makes you forget you're in New Zealand. The restaurant has a modern feel with a very small bar/tall table seating area and a larger room with a mix of seating arrangements for large groups or intimate seating. We were seated along the wall where one side is booth seating and the other is a hard back chair. The room is bright with lots of windows, an ornate red mosaic and multi-colored patterned wall paper above the booth seats. The two-seater tables are small, so I am glad it wasn't cluttered with any decor or condiments. We were greeted immediately upon walking in the door and seated just as quickly. The service from drink orders to dinner orders was also just as efficient.

The menu is very intricate with options to please anyone. For starters we had the Spring Rolls (6 for $8.50) which came out quick, were crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. The rolls were served with two sauces: a sweet sauce and a soy based sauce. I highly recommend this. Not your bag, baby? They have plenty of other options from chicken wings and guri puffs to fried pork balls and marinated spare rib. If you're a soup person, you'll have plenty of options, we personally opted to stick with a main as we wanted to order dessert. The dinner menu is jam packed with your asian favorites from fried rice to noodle dishes, but what makes Buddha Stix stand out are its curry options and stir-fry/hot plate dishes. I ordered the Garlic Chicken on a hot plate which was chicken and various vegetables cooked in a wok with garlic (frankly, I could have been hit harder with the garlic as they say it's a ""must"" for garlic lovers). This dish was served with white rice and has great flavor.  My husband had the Fresh Chili and Basil stirfry which he devoured. If you're a spice lover, you can request that the chef add some more heat, which he will gladly do. The mains are big portions and would be perfect split for two dinners. We took half of each of our dinners as takeaway.

For dessert, you must save room for the chocolate brownie. It is a slightly larger than normal brownie cut in half diagonally and served with chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream and lychee sauce. This is one of the best desserts I've had in a while - if you're in a chocolate mood, this is for you! Overall, the entire meal was under $80 (including two drinks, a beer and a glass of wine). What a deal! With food this good and prices this cheap, we will be back again and again.",3,"Denver, CO",1,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=unRiUl35qgGNv62QcETD_A

We were actually aiming for another BBQ place for dinner, but this was on the way and we decided to be adventurous and give it a try.

I had the pulled pork plate, Mister S had the brisket burger, and we were intrigued by the spiced cauliflower so we shared it.

The pork was fine. A little fatty (to be expected with pork shoulder) and not quite as flavorful as I've had elsehwere. Comes with pickles, a creamy slaw, crisps, and a whole grain mustard sauce that was absolutely inedible. I don't know if it was off or whether that was how it was supposed to taste, but yikes. The spiced cauliflower (spiced, not spicy) was so interesting - lots of flavor from the spices juicy-tart pomegranate arils.

They have a kid's menu, but we figured our little guy would just eat off ours and we weren't wrong. (He's still in that phase where he loves something one day and won't touch it the next - a pain when you're spending good money on food!) Case in point, the macaroni and cheese. He usually eats his body weight in noodles, but barely touched the side we ordered to share. It tasted great, so don't trust his review! There was plenty of food in our own meals for us to share with him, too.

Lots of choices for drinks. I was trying to decide between two different choices and the server offered to bring me a sample of both so I could taste.  

Good service. Upstairs seating with some outside chairs, too. We ate early on a weekday and it wasn't very rowdy or noisy. Some larger tables upstairs were reserved, so they do take reservations.",1,"Mililani, HI",0,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mbvu8Xn8ryuCRusHsCDrLw

The place- spacious, mixture of 4 sweaters and large Chinese round table. Ample parking outside. 

The food- the main selling dishes are those that serve in a stone pot. Has a curry based flavor. You can pick your meat of preference. Very filling and not too spicy. Recommend not to order too many other dishes of you are getting this one. The Szechuan spicy chicken is juicer now, and not over powered with chili. I still preferred the old dry and spicy version but others in my table really enjoyed it.

Drinks- a wall full of Chinese liquor for you to choose from. Tea is free.

The falafel was way below average. In the description they highlight it as crisp from the outside and moist from the inside, it was moist on both layers. Also felt very oily, should decrease the oil to get it to be crispy from the outside.

The chicken was good but then again I like this dish so it's hard not to satisfy me. The taste is very similar to ""sheesh taowe"" from a Lebanese restaurant. I would recommend ordering the chicken dish.

The lamb was just ok and again felt like ""tikka"" from a Lebanese restaurant so nothing special there.

Finally we got the baklava for dessert. The portion was big (we ordered the big size they also do have a mini if you want to taste) and it was good. Again I tasted mush better in Turkish restaurants.

My brother and I learned about this place from a staff member at the Hyatt Regency in Sydney, who let us know that this was one of her favorite places to go when back home in Christchurch (especially for the chicken bones).  So we decided to center our day around visiting it, once we got off the ship on a Thursday.  It's more than 3 km from the centre of Christchurch, so a decent trek, but was able to take a bus back after a filling meal.  It also brought us to the Riccarton neighborhood.  If there is a 'Chinatown' in Christchurch, the Riccarton neighborhood is probably it.  There were a ton of places that we passed, that we would also try out if we had time.

The restaurant opens at 11 and was already fairly busy when we stopped in around that time.  It is an open kitchen, staffed by two ladies.  As one can imagine, they were very busy but were still very friendly and patient to answer our questions.  We learned that they will throw in the chicken bones with any purchase.   The menu itself is not specific to Cambodia but is a mixture.    I was really craving noodle soup, so ended up getting three dishes along with an app to share between the two of us.

#7 Noodles Soup with Chicken (NZ$17) - the better of the two soups, it used the flavorful broth from all that chicken bone braising.  You have your choice of thick or thin rice noodles, and they give you plenty.   I enjoyed nibbling on the chicken bones, trying to find those missed meat morsels.

#9 Beef Noodles Soup (NZ$18.50) - I thought this was OK.  The broth was very clean and it did come with uniform strips of food grade quality beef, and a lot of rice noodles.

Shrimp Pad Thai (off menu) - (NZ$ 25) - This was an OK rendition, with a decent amount of well-cooked shrimp.

Deep fried spring rolls (NZ$9.50) - Both of us really liked this dish, using whole seasoned shrimp, wrapped in spring roll paper to resemble miniature cones.  They were freshly deep fried and were delicious, coming with a sweet Thai chili sauce.

They market themselves as a noodle house specializing in Chinese and Thai favorites, but also with a Cambodian flair.  With their large portions and reasonable prices, free wifi for customers, and friendly hospitality, Riccarton Noodle House is a good stop for locals and tourists, alike.",1,"Long Beach, CA",1,2,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JEMdASHfeXcQF3zDka1fVw

f5WbfkjUOMMofXvpxK-nZw,recommended,Jonny M.,3,2018-11-21T04:25:44Z,"Second last dinner in Christchurch. We were debating between a few spots in Riccarton but ended up choosing Riccarton Noodle House, a Cambodian spot. It's more like a mix of Vietnamese, Cambodian and Malaysian. 

We dropped in on a Tuesday evening (around 7:00pm) and it was empty. The inside has a bit of Cambodia decoration (Angkor Wat painting on the wall) but other than that, it's bare. Service is non-existent. You go to the counter to order where you also can grab water and utensils (self serve). 

The menu is up above the open style kitchen; special spicy, noodle soup, satay, stir fry noodles, specials, side dishes and sweets.

- Curry laksa with chicken (#31) ($13.00 NZD) - I can never say no to laksa but in hindsight, this was a poor choice. Laksa isn't a Cambodian speciality; should have got one of their noodle soups instead. The laksa was half decent but nowhere close to being authentic. Barely any ingredients inside and they used udon noodles...
- Black pepper udon with seafood (#30) ($15.00 NZD) - we asked for claypot yee-mee and got this. No idea how the chef messed up our order. We decided to eat it but should have complained instead. Super stingy on the seafood (only a couple small pieces of squid and three prawns). The pepper was overpowering and vegetables consisted of the cheap, bland variety. Bad, just bad.

I took the drink back to the bar and asked the blonde girl who served me if I could have another where she told me she would poor the drink into a clean glass, I said no I would like a new one altogether.

I have had meningitis before so even if the glass was cleaned I am very cautious which means I see the glass and the drink no longer sanitary.

So anyway, she poured me a drink but it was only a double shot. I told her the drink she originally served was a quad shot which is when she told me I had already had a drink and she couldn't remember giving me a dirty glass and she could just give away free alcohol. It completely embarrassed me in front of everyone at the bar listening making me feel like I was trying to score extra alcohol for nothing when putting the old drink and the new drink side by side there was clearly nearly double in the old drink. I said to her if that""s the case I would rather have my money back for the double that she had re poured as at this stage I was clearly not happy with the service and how she handled the situation, when she continued to tell me she couldn't give me a refund. I know it's only a glass of spirits but being embarrassed and having service like that just getting into town lost your bar 6 customers wanting to have celebratory 30th birthday drinks at your bar.",3,"Christchurch, New Zealand",0,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Los3QgezDomdgOil_HGqSA

Visit Baretta on a weekend night and be sure you're into the bar well before 10:00 as the line of 20 and 30-somethings extends down the block. If you're visiting for the restaurant and a little taste of Italy in Christchurch, be sure to make a booking a few days in advance. They DO have Entertainment Guide coupons!

FOOD: My husband and I started with the grilled ciabatta with parsley pesto and olive jam. The bread was extremely filling, so I definitely recommend sharing with several people. The olive jam was my favorite spread, but the parsley pesto is light and bright and an interesting take on pesto. We decided to split the side salad with parmesan cheese on top and a light balsalmic dressing. It was a crisp salad with a lot of complementary tastes. I ordered the Chicken Leg as my main and it was cooked beautifully: juicy and tender. It was served with pickled pumpkins (which were very interesting) potatoes with ricotta and garnished with radishes. I cleaned the plate! I just wish there had been about one serving less of the pickled pumpkins. My husband ordered the Squid Ink Gnocchi with mussels and calamari. If you enjoy the smell of fish and seafood overload, this is the dish for you. My husband enjoyed it, but the smell was overwhelming for me (a non-fish eater). We opted to pair the meal with a bottle of Chandon, but their wine list is quite extensive and the waiter will be more than happy to offer pairing suggestions. In fact, the waiters at the restaurant are on top of their game. Never was a glass left empty nor were we left alone for too long (but not in a creepy hovering way). He seemed to have his eye on our table at all times which made the evening a breeze.

Step outside before or after your meal to enjoy a cocktail from the patio bar. Often there is live music playing and heated tables to relax on.

The restaurant is clean and modern and has great eye-appeal. You can create your own bagel sandwiches (for $7.50) or select one of their options (~$9/10). I tried the Pilgram with chicken, bacon, mayo and tomato salsa on a rock salt bagel. I HIGHLY recommend the combo. While the sandwich lacks the amount of fillings a New York bagel would have, it is still satisfying. My husband had the Big Schnitz and he enjoyed it, too.

This is a new fitout so everything is clean and fresh. The bagels are amazing. My favs are the pilgrim and the salmon. The bagels come in a variety of flavours and are freshly made with no preservatives. The fillings of the gourmet bagels are humungous and delicious.

Service is pretty good. They took a while to take our order as they were busy cooking out the back.

The Brewery (Cassels & Sons) is part of The Tannery shopping complex. They've got a narrow indoor seating area next to the bar and wood-fired pizza oven, and also a spacious outdoor area with plastic sidings and roof in wet or windy weather. Every time I've been here, I've sat in the outdoor area, which is nice even though your view is basically of the parking lot.

This place can get pretty busy, so just be aware at peak times that you might have a bit of a wait before you can find a seat. Father's Day breakfast was a 45-minute wait (somewhat understandable) but even on regular weekends this place can get busy.

The food is uninspired. They really have nothing on the menu for vegans, except hummus and flatbread. For breakfast, all I could order was the toast with jam and cream sans the cream. The staff was rather unapologetic about this as well. Guess they don't get many vegans in here.

My parents also felt the food was a bit so-so. Also, they'd run out of the dish that my dad wanted, so he had to choose something else. (Father's Day problems again, I guess.)

The pizza flavours are quite different, think Pear, blue cheese, thyme & smoked bacon,  and an ever changing Pizza of the Week flavour.  I had to settle for an apple cider when I last visited; while admittedly very tasty, I was keen to try the grape and berry cider (sadly sold out).

They've got a whole heap of seating, indoors and outdoors, making it suitable for group gatherings.  Often there is a band playing in the afternoon.

The food itself was okay. Three people at the table ordered the steak - they said it was nice enough but the meat probably wasn't very high quality - they were also slightly overcooked, one person ordered the rack of lamb which again was okay but nothing to rave about, another ordered the fish on risotto which she said was a bad combination and I ordered the crispy chicken which wasn't too bad but the chicken was a little overcooked.

There's this one girl that has it all wrong. This place is awesome. I'm 30yrs old at current, and she claimed that she and her friend were in their 20's. Yes, the crowd is more mature, but it is mixed. 

I was there with people my age, people older than us, and people younger than us, and not everyone who was there was there for the birthday boy. I dressed up too, but I didn't feel out of place. You wear what you want, within reason/appropriateness, and the better dressed you are the less it can hurt!

The bartenders were kind and professional. There's one pool table at the center where people can pay to play. Two C-shaped booth areas one to the left of the entrance upon walking in, and one at the rear left behind the mini-stage where we got to be entertained by a local singer. She sang mellow and sad cover songs, which sounded nice, but were not the right tune for the night. The background music they played when the singer took breaks was chill and upbeat, and not excessively loud! Yay, don't have to scream over each other to order a drink or have a conversation. 

The highchairs at the bar area aren't stationed in and can be moved about, which is great for small to medium sized groups.

The restrooms are at the rear of the space. Decent and plenty of space. 

I did not try any of the bites, only had a beer ($5.00) and a glass of water. 

It's part of a mini shopping center, and it's a hidden gem, if you ask me. Next time some friends opt to hang out there or celebrate, I'll be back!

The service was terrible. The waitress was unapproachable & had a bit of a attitude (worst thing is I am sure she was the duty manager). My friend asked what was gluten-free as she can get severely sick from ingesting gluten- this comment was not well received & she was told to read the menu. The menu did not say whether the fish was dredged in flour! The potato skins promised truffle but sadly there was none. The main meals were good. The dessert was very lack lustre. The PBJ was average- only redeeming part was the raspberry sorbet. My friend got the ice-cream sandwich which was inedible. You needed a pick-axe to even attempt it. The part we could try was the ice-cream but only a small bit we managed to chip off. It was icy!! What was the chef thinking even plating this up! The sponge was rock solid. My friend paid for it & all the chef said that if we'd said something about it, they could've fixed it. We did but the waitress didn't care. And let's be real- there was no saving that dessert.

I was a little nervous, but we chose to stay and were seated at a tall top table by the window. I suppose the crew that visited Town Tonic into the wee hours of the morning were still sleeping off their hangovers.

 Our waiter was a little quirky, but friendly and efficient. We ordered an americano and a trim flat white. They both arrived quickly.  The menu is very concise which makes choosing your entree easy. There are your breakfast classics: muesli or french toast, but the rest of the menu features eclectic specialty items that are impeccably prepared: Mexican Salad, Duck Liver, French Sardines, vegetarian options or the Gourmet Croque Madame.

The croque madame was served on thick slices of bread with prosciutto ""really good cheese"" (their words, not mine), mustard all drowned in truffle oil with a fried egg on top. If you're not a true fan of truffle oil, this sandwhich will be a bit overwhelming by the second half, but the first half will be amazing. I ate every bite.

The large hot breakfast looked like something straight from a mexican restaurant: Mushrooms, potatoes with jalapeños, tomatoes, a fried egg. My husband licked the plate clean and said this is one of his all time favorite meals in Christchurch (he didn't even save me a bite).

This cafe became a little escape for me as my mom required unexpected surgery while we were visiting from the States. It was always very busy but I always somehow managed to grab a table on the patio. Most of the outdoor seating is covered but there were a few that weren't. I happily took one in the sun as I was growing tired of the hospital ward staleness. 

You order at the counter, get a number and have a seat. They have a large selection of pastries and pre made sandwiches as well as a large sit down menu. Soups, salads, sandwiches, fish. All kinds of good stuff. I didn't eat breakfast there but they have pancakes, eggs, etc. Food and drinks are brought out to you. Service was always friendly and very prompt. I was regularly surprised at how quickly my food came out despite how busy it was. 

Lamb burger was delicious. Freshest feta I've ever had and the beet compote type thing on it was delish. I could have eaten that alone as a side dish. My one gripe was that it also had mayo and tomato on it which wasn't stated on the menu. I hate when places don't list all the ingredients they plan to put on my sandwich. I HATE mayo so that was a bummer. Luckily it was mostly on the lettuce so I was able to get it mostly off :)

Another day I had the fish and chips. It was very clear that fish was probably swimming this morning. Yum yum yum fresh!

My favorite by far was the chicken, pesto and Brie sandwich. Chicken was grilled perfectly and that pesto, oh that pesto! It puts other pestos to shame. Easily the best and most fresh pesto I've ever had. Swoon indeed.

The owner is very passionate about their food, and it's obvious that he's in the business because he loves bringing joy into people's lives by providing a wonderful dining experience. 

He's happy to tell you about the food you're eating, such as how he would normally be eaten, or on what occasions, or how it differs from similar Indian dishes. For me that is a very wonderful addition to the meal, but if you are just looking for a place to consume your requisite nutrients and get on with your day then you should consider saving this restaurant for an occasion when you can give the experience the attention it deserves. 

Every time I have gone I have gotten one of the specials, which have variable names like ""Chicken Special No.2,"" but they have consistently been the most delightful meals--ones that are not only tasty, but also complicated enough that you're glad you're not trying to make your own version in your own kitchen. The one I had on my previous visit was the best chicken dish which I have had in years. 

I highly recommend this place.",2,"East Amherst, NY",1,0,0,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wTOSwqMporsLDHn6AxAHBg

However, having travelled in Bangladesh and knowing many Bangladeshis I was disappointed. The food took a long time to come - they kept saying it was cooked fresh but having to wait over 40 minutes for some simple starters isn't great. Most restaurants I go to cook their food fresh and it doesn't take that long. The quality of the food was also pretty poor - the fish cake starter was dry and lacked flavor, and my daughter had the chicken and rice which looked very unappetizing, tasted pretty mediocre, and was only lukewarm. When we complained about the long wait for the food the owner was rude and aggressive - both to us, and the the woman who was serving us -- he tried to blame her for the delay for some of our items by saying that she should have told us they were unavailable (even though they clearly were available because he delivered them to us five minutes later??!???). They have some work to do to improve the quality of their food and their service if they want to tempt me back. I would not recommend them and I would not eat here again. Very poor. I am sure the owner will respond and claim that we were unreasonable - ordinarily I would say go along and see for yourself, but I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone. The food is not worth it and the service sucks!!",3,"Los Angeles, CA",1,0,2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=o5mJtzcAwiBKW_RWsh2t1Q

We ordered the rice bowl with salmon and sweet egg and a ramen bowl with chicken. It actually tasted pretty good. We also shared a salmon roll, this particular one had cream cheese in it, which I ended up not caring for. 

On another occasion we decided to try the sushi burger with chicken. It ended up being difficult to hold since the chicken was sliding out from between the two rice patties. There was a reason why they served it with a fork.

We were really craving sushi, but unfortunately their sushi department is rather lacking and they aren't made fresh to order. I tried the Teppan Teriyaki Chicken Bento Value Set and the chicken was extremely tender. The rice was cooked okay and the miso soup was good, but the salad lacked any dressing. My husband and I also ordered edamame as well as our other friend and they only brough one order to us. After we explained it to them, it took about 10 minutes to get the other edamame and they had to verify with us 3 times that we actually did order two. My husband had the salmon ngiri which looked really fresh, and the Tori Tama (hot udon noodles with a fried egg and crispy chicken) which was really flavorful. I would come back for that!

Pretty interesting things on offer here, different from your typical sushi joint. A particularly interesting offer was the rice burgers. In place of a bun the burgers had a sicky rice cake. Sounded weird but totally worked. 

Bit of a letdown how few veg options were on offer here. They were also a bit inflexible on adding/subbing tofu to things, which I wasn't too pleased about. We veggie types need protein too!!!

I went for the tempura burger which was strangely delightful. Crunchy tempura in place of meat, with peri peri sauce. I have to admit I went back for a second I was so taken with it! Also got the agadashi tofu which was really nice. 

My dinner mates got some of the noodle bowls which looked beautiful with lots of different toppings.

We came here for a group dinner and they had set aside the Oval Room for us that has TVs, a fireplace and seating for about 30 people. We had great service both from the wait staff and at the bar when we needed to order drinks. 

I ordered the Chicken stonegrill which had a sort of teriyaki marinade on it with a garden salad and mashed potatoes. The chicken was also served with three different dipping sauces including a sweet and sour, ranch and chipotle mayo. I preferred the chipotle mayo. The chicken cooks very quickly and is easy to overdo, so be sure to monitor it closely. My husband ordered the Canterbury Fillet stonegrill which he cooked to about medium rare before pulling them off the grill. This also cooks very quickly! His sides were the seasonal veges and kumara mash. We both finished our entire plates. 

This location does trivia on thursdays, also in the oval room, and absolutely requires a booking at least a few days in advance (if not more). This is different from most trivia venues because it is in an intimate setting with only so many spaces for players.

A visit to the McDonald's on Memorial Ave has left much to be desired. The moment I stepped inside, it was clear that the level of service wasn't up to standard.

The first problem arose at the ordering counter, where it was like they didn't give a damn or cared to take care of customers. It seemed to be as if my being there was a nuisance for them. Although the service lacked oomph, I pushed ahead with my order because I hoped that there'd be a surprise waiting for me on the platter.

Unfortunately, this was not to be. The company's character would be the inedible food. The fries were lukewarm and soggywhich certainly was a far cry from the hot, crisp standard I've come to expect of other golden arches. The burger was no better, smashed together and rather lifeless.

Another problem plaguing this McDonald's was cleanliness. Tables were abandoned to patrons past, covered with crumbs and spills. The overall hygiene of the dining area was suspect, and I have my doubts about how clean the kitchen or food preparation areas were.

Also, the restroom was hardly attractive. It was dirty, there were bad odors and visible dirt; it needed immediate attention. Those conditions are something a fast-food restaurant, never mind one as big and globalized as McDonald's ought to be able to prevent.

Finally, my visit to this McDonald's was one I would regret. Service overall was indifferent; food quality poor and cleanliness ignored. I hope that the management takes steps to resolve these problems and help restore McDonald's reputation, which it has been building over decades. And right now, I cannot pinpoint this particular location and tell others to try it if they want a positive experience with fast food.
