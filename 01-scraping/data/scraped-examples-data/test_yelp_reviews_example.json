Intimate space in a lovely location with great service, expansive wine selection and they are happy to make you a tasty mocktail that suits your palate. \n\nNow... the food. Epic. Seasonal. Simple. Divine. I started with their marinated tomato salad which was fresh and flavorful. Entree was the steak with potato, onion rings and veggies - absolutely incredible. Naturally I had to save room for dessert and landed on the vanilla crème brûlée (though all the options sounded amazing). It came with fresh fruit and pistachio biscotti and was a great way to round out the meal. \n\nI would come back here again and again and again. Bravo!!",

Both were incredible, especially the duck liver pate. Will definitely be back if I'm in town again",

At $42, it was definitely overpriced. I have had bigger portions at about half the price for the same taste elsewhere in NZ. The service was hectic and spotty.

During our visit to Christchurch we found several interesting places to eat and wanted to make our last night special by choosing this locally well rated restaurant. \n\nAs the name suggests, you enter by climbing 27 steps to find a very small space with minimalist furnishings of very simple tables and chairs. A small complete bar is to your right as you enter - we were quickly seated at a postage stamp sized table. The menu is basically what the chef fancies to prepare for dinner - so on-line menus just list items that are basic rather than recommended for each evening. I enjoy one of the best prepared filet Mignons I have eaten in a long time and shared some of my wife's risotto and a house made bread to make a wonderful tasting meal! Although they were very busy, our server took her time with us to ensure we got the best of what they had to offer - including a very tasty Pinot Noir fro the region. \n\nHighly recommend and will be back!",

I know it can be tiring working in hospitality but we did not feel like valued customers even though we were paying the $$$ prices. We were hurried through our entree and main, and the request of dessert was hurried. We said no to dessert as we weren't ready, and the bill immediately came to the table. We hadn't finished our drinks and felt like we were just being pushed out the door. We had a reservation by the way, 6pm, Sunday night. Hardly a peak busy night where they are trying to turn people through quickly. Otherwise service was prompt and \"polite\" enough. But not warm or inviting. \nAnyway - if you've made it this far - the food was so lovely! I had pan seared scollops with pork belly and a perfectly cooked beef fillet with potato gratin. \n4 stars because of the waitress's attitude.",

The mains were a special risotto of pears and spring onions and ricotta that tasted so much like freshness on a plate, and the venison special, which melted in our mouths.  Dessert (embarrassing, I know, that we kept eating) was a blood orange crème brûlée that we just couldn't resist. Service was attentive and fun. Decor is minimal and chic. Get here. Don't miss it.",

        "text": "We just happened upon this place during our visit, and last stop, in Christchurch. it seemed slow in dead on the first floor but we were led up to the second floor and saw how packed and lively it was! We decided to split three courses, all were exceptional. The first course we ordered were are the sautéed lamb kidneys, something neither of us have had before and it was so flavorful very tender. We have been so impressed with the meat in New Zealand so we ordered the aged Canterbury 200g beef cooked medium rare. Wow. You will taste nothing like this in the United States. Highly recommend!!!! For dessert, we ordered one of their seasonal selections which had a confit pear, ice cream, caramel popcorn, and praline. All plated so beautifully.",

We walked in at the opening time of 5pm as we didn't have reservations and for the entire hour we were there a handful of tables were seated during that time; Pro Tip: have an early dinner! We had the scallop and chorizo app, 300g rib eye special, and a couple cocktails. The star of the show was the Rib Eye with duck fat and horseradish cream; I have lived in the Midwest US for the past 5 years and I thought it was in definite competition with steak I have had in the meat Mecca, which is saying a lot. Sadly we didn't stay for dessert but they had several that I considered, get one so I can live vicariously thru you.",

They also had a pretty extensive wine list with delicious selections!\n\nThe most delicious part of our meal was the chargrilled chicory, cauliflower, dates with a coconut yogurt (tasted like lemon ricotta cheese) and organic greens.  \n\nWe also had the soup or the day - which was yam with spinach and buttermilk topped with amazing pesto. Delicious and warm - perfect for a cold night. We alsohad the special appetizer of the day - scallops with chorizo. The scallops were a tad small - but I always feel like restaurants overcharge for scallops - so this was somewhat to be expected. We finished off with the beef fillet with vegetables, potato and Yorkshire pudding.  The beef fillet was cooked perfectly and since we got the leaner cut of meat, they added camembert cheese - yum!",

You definitely need a reservation, especially if you're coming in after 6pm.\n\nThey start you off with a thick piece of herby bread and butter and a jug of lemon water. To drink I tried a glass of the \"skin ferment\" wine, which I'd never heard of, but the servers insisted it was worth a try. It has a reddish orangey color, kind of like rum punch. And it tastes a bit like fruit juice or cider. It wasn't bad! I don't know that I would order it again with dinner, but it could be a fun drink-outside-with-your-friends wine, like rosé's cousin.\n\nFor dinner I went with the herb crusted salmon over a bed of roasted potatoes, tomatoes, and capers. It was pretty good, but I wasn't able to finish it. The salmon portion was huge and it was just drenched in herbs; too much for my taste. The potatoes and tomatoes were on point though!\n\nService is friendly, but slow. It took awhile for my order to be taken, and my wine came after my food. \n\nOverall a decent dinner. I'd be curious to try some of their other dishes.",

        "text": "Wow! So many good things to say about this place. Definitely make a reservation as it is a cozy place with limited seating. \n\nTo begin, the decor is adorable and welcoming; the staff is super friendly and attentive; and the seating is comfortable and cozy. \n\nI sat alone, but had great conversation with the different staff. One of my servers discussed my wine tastes before letting me try two before settling on a glass. Both of her picks were spot on AND she let me know that a bottle was open that was not normally open so I could try a glass of that, as well. Really great service there. \n\nLet's start with the bread- homemade heaven with butter. Crumbles in your mouth. I don't normally eat bread- this bread is bomb.\n\nI was having trouble deciding on the menu since everything that was delivered near me looked and smelled amazing. \n\nI settled on the roasted red capsicum tomato and red onion soup with got cheese, terragon and lemon creme fraiche. While not a fan of goat cheese (AT ALL) this was a delight hunt of flavor in a wonderful soup. It's light and creamy but still satisfying and bursting with flavor. They also let me get a *teacup* size since I didn't want to ruin my appetite on the starter. \n\nFor the main, I chose the Pan fried salmon with capers, garlic crush potatoes, summer veg, and a banana prawns + lobster Marie Rose sauce topped with a cucumber salsa. The salmon fell apart on my plate. Even the roasted tomatoes on the side were amazing. \n\nI've had salmon 4 times while traveling NZ- this one takes the cake by far. This meal was fabulous and a great way to close out my New Zealand adventure.",

Had to wait until 7:30 for the theatre crowd to finish dinner but the dinner itself was amazing.\nWe ordered the seared ox tongue special, rack of lamb, risotto, and an affogato with ameratto.\nEach dish was splendid, especially the ox tongue. Perfectly cooked inside, lightly seared outside. Would recommend to anyone visiting Christchurch.",
